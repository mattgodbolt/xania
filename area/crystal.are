Rock Outcropping~
From this rock outcropping the valley below seems peaceful, untouched.
Dense forests of pine carpet the mountainsides, broken only by thick aspen 
woods. The mountains, deep blue in the distance, circle the valley floor and 
form a soft highland bowl.
There is a sign nailed to a nearby tree.

Small Grove~
Suddenly, soft music begins. Its source is slim, beautiful girl. Lyre in
hand, she sits gracefully as she plays; nearby, a large plainsman raises
a flute to his lips. Her voice clear as winter wind begins to sing...

Twin Flat~
A clear mountain valley sprawls about. To the northwest and southeast,
thick vallenwoods flash yellow and scarlet against the bright autumn sky.
To the east shimmers the cool blue of the Crystalmir Lake. Westward, the
valley enters a canyon rimmed by granite cliffs. The valley floor itself
continues to the northeast.
Some distance away, a group of huddled men pulls a large cart slowly
west down the Haven road. They sway rhythmically. Coarse, heavy robes
completely conceal their features.

Eye Peak soars in the distance. Barely visible from here, a sharp crack

A stream sparkles beneath an ancient stone bridge. Water tumbles
out of the forest, over the rocks, and toward the Southpass that lies between
southern Sentinel Peaks. West of the bridge, the road splits in two, branching
to the south and the west. Both roads wind among the great vallenwoods,
whose boughs form a brilliant canopy over the roadway.
