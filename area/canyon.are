A Mountain Path~
You are on a mountain path which ascends a steep mountainside.  The trail
curves around the mountain so that you cannot really see what lies ahead.
You do sense great power though coming from the area behind the mountain.

Mountainside Tombs~
There are a few stone heaps here and there, the tombs of those who did not
last the arduous journey up the mountain.  Curiously you notice a few
uncovered bodies which don't seem to have died of exhaustion.  The path curves
east around the mountain.

A Blind Curve on the Mountain Path.~
This looks like a normal mountain path, but it is NOT!  This section of the
path is habitated by a huge (and of course, man-eating) Cyclops.  The path
makes its final ascent to an overlook.

Vista~
This is a stunning vista overlooking a canyon.  There is a sign here that says:

	BEHOLD -- ELEMENTAL CANYON

Fire leaps up from firepits in the western part of the canyon.  The sky looks
funny, and the air seems hazy to the northwest.  Electricity sparks
intermittently in the northeast.  To the east you see a strong, magic-looking
river flowing through the canyon.  Also to the east you spy a cave entrance
leading into the canyon wall.  The path descends to the north to another
overlook.

Entrance to Elemental Canyon~
You are awed by the sounds and sights of great powers at works here.
Elemental servants bustle back and forth doing the biddings of the elemental
rulers.  You see a sort of cross roads to the north, and you can climb up to
the overlook here.

The Floor of the Canyon~
Various elemental forms wander the floor of the canyon.  Some seem to be
going about their business, while others seem to have no business at all.
In general, it is calm, yet there is always a incessant buzz of things
going on about.  The canyon continues north and east.

Elemental Gateway~
To the west a path dips and winds among some flowing firepits.  To the
northeast a path goes toward the river.  Beyond toward the northeast and
northwest are outcrops which rise up from the canyon floor. To the east there
is a cave mouth which leads into the canyon wall.  And to the south the path
leads up, away, and out of the canyon.  Various pure and cross-breeds of
elemental forms wander the canyon floor, which extends in a wide swath
northwards.
