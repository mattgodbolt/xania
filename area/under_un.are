Chamber of Silence~
You are standing in Silence's relaxation room.  The walls are pitch black
while the floor flows from one colour to another causing weird shadows
and colours to bounce off the walls.  Against the wall is a large map.  On
the south wall stands a large window.

There are no exits from Silence's Chamber.

Corner of Wyrm Street and Sunset~
You stand in the north western corner of the Underdark.  The bustling
streets sound distant and the hum of people moving and talking barely
reaches your ears.  The only light in this section of the city comes from
your light source.  You stands against the huge cavern's walls.  Water
glints in the light on the walls.

Worm Street goes east, and Sunset goes south

North east corner on Wrym and Sunrise~
You stand in the north east corner of the city.  There is an eerie calm here,
muffled echoes bounce off the cavern walls and into your ear.  You can
hear the screams of the slave, the talking of adventurers.  The cavern walls
loom up to the east and north of you.  You light doesn't even illuminate up
to the ceiling.  Darkness surrounds you.  The ground is hard and grey.  The
walls are grey, and glint with wetness.  You wish you could recall to
Midgaard, but alas, that is impossible.

surface dwellers for you wish you could see the moon, not the continuous
darkness that lives in this city.  Everywhere darkness creeps, even with the
lights that adorn some of the streets, it is still dark. To your east lies the
entrance to a dark building and it see to just disappear into the night.  The
door seems to be rusted shut.

you see some of the dwellings of the creatures that inhabit this gloomy
city.  There is nothing of note that you can see here, but then again it could
just be the darkness that lies just beyond your insignificant circle of light.

names.  The street upon which you stand is nothing like sunset, the only
reason you can even think up is the fact that sunset if on the west side of
the city.  Screams echo towards you from all sides assaulting your senses.
You eyes hurt from trying to pierce the darkness that lies everywhere.  The
ground is rough through your boots.  The air is cool, and the cavern wall to
your west glints with wetness.

while walking through the Underdark that these streets were named so
because they were once veins of gems.  The were hollowed out after years
of struggle leaving tunnels all over this area, a mage cast a very powerful
spell and created this section of the cavern.  The air is stuffy and moist
here.

oddly at ease on this street.  The shadows seem less dangerous here.  The
light of the floating orbs is unsure and insecure, they seem to flicker in and
out.

Moonlight Avenues goes north and south, to the east is Diamond street

these famous stones.  It was along this road that the city was made.
Without the slave trade, the city would not have expanded as fast as it did
when the city was first built.  The Underdark has since become a trade
centre where those who dwell beneath the ground and those above can
interact in relative safety.

Slaver's Route~
You are walking along the slaver's route.  The slaver's route is a wide
street with plenty of room for flocks of slaves.  The street is well worn,
worn down by the feet of the enslaved and imprisoned.  To the west you
can hear a slave master shouting at his slaves.  Small glowing orbs light
the way for you.

The slaver's route continues east and west

Slaver's Route~
You walk along the slaver's route.    The sounds of people living, dying,
fighting threatens to overwhelm your senses.  The smell of human and non-human
bodies irritates your nose.  The sweet, tangy smell of sweat and blood causes
your stomach to turn.
Squinting in the dim light, you think you see a huddled form lying off
to the side of the road.

form body huddled~
You see a huddled form of what seems to be a slave.  It is dressed in dirty
rags and stares blankly into the distance.  With your knowledge and
experience with death, you realise that this form fits in quite well with all
the other dead bodies you have encountered in your life.  The body seems
to have been beaten and whipped 'till the slave died. ~

Slaver's Route~
You stand on the slaver's route, so named for the simple reason that the
slaver's use this road to transport their merchandise.  The slaver's in the
Underdark are renowned for their cruelty, you can tell that this rumour is
true by all the screams of pain and horror that seem to come from all
around you.  The shadows of the city seem to live and breed by
themselves.  Above your head are small floating orbs that bathe the street
with a dim light.

To the east is the eastern entrance, to the west, the slaver's route.

Before the east entrance~
You stand just at the east entrance to the Underdark.  Before you looms a
huge cavern, or so you think, since you can't tell with your eyes.  Darkness
is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people. but also agonized screams.  The shadows seems to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark.

The north and south is Sunrise, to the east is the entrance and to the west is
the Slaver's route and farther down, the market area.

The Gathering Place~
You are in the north west corner of the gathering place.  It is here that the
denizens of the Underdark come to meet to discuss business.  The lighting
here is dimmer than in most places.  Dark shapes seem to blend in and out
of the shadows.  Somehow the sounds of the city do not invade this place
so it is quiet enough to discuss without shouting.  The square is basically
clear but the dimness makes it impossible to see farther than 10 feet, thus
making it perfect for meetings of a discrete manner.  It seems as if some
orbs have stopped working.

forms wander at the edge of your vision, you can't tell if it your

here.  The only illumination is from your light source.  No sounds reach
your ears only your breathing and the blood gushing through your body.
Everything seems to be distance, nothing looks real.  You feel isolated
from society as a whole, ignored, worthless.  There is nothing to live for,
people whisper in the shadows, plotting the downfall of the world.
Nothing can stop it, there is no point.  How can you as an individual make
a difference?  For a moment, these words form in the air "Welcome to the
darkside" you feel empty and drained.  No life stirs within, a chill
threatens to overcome your entire being.

You are in one of the most oppressed regions of the Underdark.  It is here
that the capitalist dream has become totally realised.  The oppression and
repression of those who should be free is evident in everything that stands
in this square.  Stocks to hold the bad slaves, a guillotine to kill the slaves
that stand up for their rights.  The slaves are reduced to animals in this
square.

execution.  The ground is clean, with dark brown spots here and there.
The dark brown stains are stains of blood.

ground has dark brown stains on it.  The cruel reality of slavery can be felt
by your soul, causing is to ache to own and manipulate other beings.  You
can realise this desire to the west.

name is a joke on those surface dwellers who may crave the sun.  Sunrise
travels along the eastern cavern wall.  The Underdark is a huge city
compared to Midgaard.  The city that was founded has grown to fill the
cavern and thrives in the dark.  Over half the people who live here can see
in the dark, the floating orbs were placed for the surface dwellers so they
could kinda see.

enters your head, the shadows begin to come alive.  Always, just out of

now is about 2 times larger than Midgaard.  This is the meeting place of
the rogues and thieves from the world of sun and moon and those who
dwell beneath the earth.

huge guardian eyes float through the city preventing open fights.  Glowing
orbs float in the air, casting their dim glow on all around.  Illuminating
basically nothing but giving some light.

city like most of the city isn't very well lit.  A solitary glowing orb floats
casting a thin circle of light on the ground.  As with all sections of this
street, this part has been dedicated to a god, Silence.  As soon as you
realise this, you understand why this section of the city is so quiet. A statue
of a githzerai seems to be kneeling to a statue of Silence.

there is a note that reads

    Silence is both provider and destroyer, to be blessed by him is to
be blessed indeed.

Silence and notice that it's eyes glow purple and seem to be watching your

Street of the Gods, Soapbox~
This street has been built to honour the gods of the realms.  Since the
street was built, the Underdark has flourished.  You have heard rumours
that at certain sections on this street, you can actually recall.  The street
has been indeed blessed by the gods.  On the ground are a series of arcane
symbols.

The street goes on east and west, to north is the gathering place.

Street of the Gods, Garion~
You are standing on the street of the gods.  Instead of building a temple,
the denizens of the Underdark built a road dedicated to them.   This
section of the road honours Garion and his true understanding of the fabric
of life.  Garion with his foresight to bring people together so they can
defend themselves from their enemies and unite for a common goal.

this name is very obvious.  All around you more shadows then there should
be form.  Everything seems to be cloaked in it's own shadow.  The light of
the orbs and from your light source does nothing to illuminate the area.

There is a strong sense of death here.  It seems to be living in the dark that
surrounds you.  There are no sounds here, not even the tread of a mouse.  It
is so quiet that it seems as if it is the silence of death.

The alley continues east and west.

You are walking down through the forgotten alley.  The sounds of the city

hangs in the air.  A solitary glowing orb floats in the air, flickering on and
off giving off a little illumination so you can barely see the road.

shiver.  You have heard that death lives in this alley, one of the reasons
why the citizens of the Underdark do not venture here.

To the east and north the alley continues, west is a dark door.

entire cavern was filled with veins of gems and precious metals.  It was
first mined by the duergar who lost it to the drow.  Much later a mighty
wizard came to the area and created a huge cavern from the many tunnels.
Where the mighty veins once were now only roads exist.

You head down traveller's crescent.  No shadows lie off to the side of the
road, so there is no hidden threat (unless invisible).  The glowing orbs here
seems to flicker on and off, but even with this inconsistent lighting, the
street seems to glow with life.

Dark Tunnel~
You stand in a dark tunnel.   You light source illuminates a cleanly cut
tunnel.  You seem to be standing where it ends. On the wall you see
scribbled in blood:

Progress only if thee canst be seen or if thou art powerful
The air is dry but cold.  The floor is even without any marks of tools.  The
walls are straight without any indication that mining tools have carved this
tunnel, only to the north are there any marks at all.

The tunnel plunges into darkness to the south and a stone door lies to the
north.

standing side by side here.  The floor has levelled off and has been worn
smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks. You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals it's surface counterpart,
Midgaard.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the Underdark.  A
dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten levels of
experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a series of
markings that you can't make out at this distance.

years ago, and has prospered here below Midgaard.  For some reason, the
mage cast a mighty spell that cursed the entire city preventing people from
recalling out of it.  This makes it a perfect place to sell slaves and buy
slaves.  Although most think it as being lawless, there is a code and this
code is enforced by huge floating eyes.

Good luck,
