A fluffy white cloud.~
You find yourself standing on a small cloud.  The cloud feels kind
of spongy beneath your feet.  You find it hard to see anything in
the distance as wisps of cloud blow over your face.

A floating sign says:

"Scubdu's Area--Tread carefully! Only high levels should attempt
this place. Leave messages on the board if you have problems."

been set up for spectators and players to enjoy themselves.

You slide down the moisture covered rock, gaining speed as you
approach the cliff.  Realizing your foolish error, you madly claw
at the rock, vainly trying to get a precious hold and save your
worthless hide.  Next time, heed your conscience.

You've fallen, and you can't get up!!!
