A fluffy white cloud.~
You find yourself standing on a small cloud.  The cloud feels kind
of spongy beneath your feet.  You find it hard to see anything in
the distance as wisps of cloud blow over your face.

A floating sign says:

"Scubdu's Area--Tread carefully! Only high levels should attempt
this place. Leave messages on the board if you have problems."
