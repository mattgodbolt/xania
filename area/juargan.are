Beneath the waterfall~
As you wring your clothes, you see sunlight reflect beautifully off the
waterfall, forming at rainbow.  With the sparkling illumination, you think you
see a cave to the south.

By the beautiful waterfall~
You see a VERY beautiful waterfall here.  It looks almost as if diamonds are
falling down the mountain.  (You reach out and grab and no, it IS only water.)
It looks so nice here, you feel like taking a nap.
The trail leads north and south.

greenness, a waterfall.  To the west, you see the trail along the valley.

green forests south-east.  To the north, you see the Mountains of Moria.  To

water and don't think the sun is going to help your thirst.  The closest shade
appears to be the dwarf forest, which is VERY far away.
