#There are several "operators" available:
#  pattern matching:     Which work only in ( string | string & (str ~ str))
#        |       or
#        &       and
#        ~       and-not
#  special pattern matching:
#        ^       match start  This anchors the match to the beginning of the 
#                             input string.
#        =       exact match  This must match the input string entirely.
#  pass 1 scan operators:
#        #       remark
#        &<num>  start a new database section.
#        $       complete the current database. Required before starting a new database section.
#        "       output to stderr
#        >       keywords when looking up a database based on NPC names 
#	     @       adds a link to a database identified by number. Ex: @1
#                 will make a continue link to database 1.  Use @0
#                 to link to the default database. Only 1 @ per database.
#                 @ cannot do forward links!!!
#                 You must avoid circularities with @.
#  response operators:
#        1-9     weights are the numerals. First column only. Mandatory.
#        "       Issue response as "say".   Muds and 2nd column only. Optional.
#	 :       Issue repsonse as "emote". Muds and 2nd column only. Optional.
#        !       Issue response as command. Muds and 2nd column only. Optional.

#  
#        $?      Are variables where ? is a case sensitive letter.
#                 $r is rest of sentence, $n is its name, $t is target's name.
#                 They may appear anywhere in the response, multiple times.
#        
#Some special notes:
#	#,',",weights, and the first ( must be in column one.
#
#Syntax of a simple pattern match:
#
#( A | B & C ~ ( D | E | F))
#
#The above would mean if A or B and C and-not D or E or F was in the
#sentence then pick one of the responses.
#
#The responses take on the form:
#
#9this is most likely
#4somewhat likely
#1least likely
#
#Responses or pattern match strings may not span more than one line.  
#The guaranted line length is a magic 80 characters (letters) wide. 
#
#Please note the system will return the first match found. So
#please put more ambigous matches last!!
#

#I suggest adding to this database.


# $r is a variable.  It means rest of sentence after the match.
#Variables only appear in weighted reponse clauses.
#Weighted clauses are '9This is a clause', with 9 being the weight.
# $n is the non player characters name
# $t is the targets name (the person who being replied to)
# $$ is equal to $

3Why would you want me to kill $r?
2How much will you pay me?

# equals  = means exact match not a substring match
# The exact operator has some limitations. It must be by a left paren.
# Actually the only case proven to work is when its by itself.
# as in (=name)  (=) doesnt match anything, while () matches everything
