A Dark Alleyway~
The walls of the alleyway have been spray-painted over many times
over the years.  One section of graffiti actually looks legible,
it says:    This section has been designed for levels 5 through 10
            If you are above level 15 please don't expect much fun.
            If you are below level 5 enter at your own risk.
Another section of graffiti says "Raff Rules!"
There is a boulevard to the east and Emerald Avenue is visible to the west.

Beginning of White Dragon Boulevard~
This section of town has been overrun by the Troll gang.  Even the
police stay out of here for fear of being brutalized.  This was once
a nice lower-middleclass neighborhood, but know the gangs run the
streets.  All the shops and homes have been boarded up and abandoned.
An alleyway is to the west and the street continues east.  An over-
grown lot is to the south.

You can see a sinister black wrought-iron fence to the west.

The inn/pub~
The inn actually looks fairly functional despite its lack
of repair.  The boys come here to hoot it up and drink them selves
into oblivion sometimes.  It looks as if the beer is still on tap!!!
A hallway leads south and you spy a street through the doorway
to the north.

Solomon Street~
A wrought-iron fence blocks off what used to be an entrance to the
cemetery here to the north.  The evil just seems too strong to
to consider entering.  You feel you should stick with the "lesser"
evils along the road to the east and west.
