~

0 ADDRESS~
Xania is hibernating at the moment, sorry!
~

0 FINGER~
Usage: finger <character name>

This command shows information about a character, like his/her real name,
email address, home page address and a message. In addition, if you have
the privilege to do so, you will be shown the last time that this character
was logged into Xania. This is mostly useful to immortals and to clan
leaders to track whether players have been logged in or not.

The information shown is set by using the setinfo command. Please see
help on setinfo for more information.
~

0 DAMAGE~
When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown in the
verb used in the damage message.  The description of wounds can vary
wildly depending on the way you are attacking your opponent, for example 
using a fire spell will probably yield different results to using a
dagger.

If you are using an ANSI colour terminal (help colour) the colour of
the description will to some extent, indicate the level of damage. A
moderate level of damage will be in |Ggreen|w, a high level of damage
will be in |Yyellow|w, a fatal blow is likely to be |Wwhite|w or |Rred|w!
~



0 DEATH~
  -- "The reaper holds the hourglass with your name on it"

When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of
the Temple of Isca.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you
were killed, together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays
with you as Death doesn't care much for money.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by Death.

Following and groups are not affected by Death.

You lose experience points for dying:

|WIf you are below level 25:|w
The amount you lose is half-way back to the beginning of your level.  Thus if 
you have a bad day and die several times,  the penalties won't clobber you.

|WIf you are level 25 and above:|w
The amount you lose is half of your experience to level.  This means you can
and will lose levels if you die with less than half a level's worth of
experience!!

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse. If the victim type 'noloot' his corpse can be
looted but it is recommended that you only do this if someone urgenty
needs to remove the contents from your corpse.

~




92 IMMCHALLENGE~
Challenge is a mild form of PKILL; think of it as player duelling rather than
player killing. It permits players to fight in the combat arena. In order for
the fight to go ahead, an immortal of level 95+ must be available to supervise
and the players must be over level 20.

If a player challenges another, you will be prompted on the immortal channel.
It is the choice of a level 95+ immortal whether they undertake supervision
or not. Your |Woptions|w will be given to you when a challenge is made. Only
permit the challenge to go ahead if the circumstances are fair and the
intentions of the duellists genuine, i.e. don't permit it if someone
is challenging merely to irritate or intimidate someone.

When the challenge has been accepted by both players, you will type |cready|w.
The players will then be prompted to type ready too and this will trigger the
players to be automatically |Wtransferred|w to the preparation room. Restore
the duellists and let them spell up there and then. It is your discretion
whether you restore them for a second time or not.

You can stop the duel at any time by typing 'cancel'. Advise the players to
recall before they type ready if they have a pet, this way they know exactly
where the pet will be after the duel.

It is up to you to make sure that use of challenge doesn't cause bad vibes
between players; something which PKILL can do quite easily. Both you and
the players should maintain good MUD etiquette, e.g. if one disarms the other
and takes the weapon during the duel, he should return it after! As the
controlling Imm, you are responsible for the smooth running of any duels.

Duelling might be included as part of a quest but remember that for events
such as this, a certain level of fairness must be maintained i.e. don't have
players who are 20 levels apart fighting each other.

~

0 CHALLENGE~
Syntax: challenge <character>
        on line help is given when you are challenged

The challenge command may be used to initiate a duel between you and another
player, given that you are above level 20. If you are challenged yourself,
you will be presented with the basic details of the challenger and you will
have a time limit within which you will be able to |Waccept|w the challenge.

You will be given guidance about turning down, accepting and preparing for
a duel by the immortals of Xania when you are challenged.

|WDuels can be viewed|w by other players if they go to the Midgaard viewing
gallery which overlooks the Combat arena.

See also: |Whelp pkill|w and |Chelp duel|w
~

0 PKILL 'PLAYER KILL'~

Although |Wchallenge|w is a form of |Wplayer killing|w it is not as extreme
as seen on other MUDS. Challenge is a way of testing your combat prowess
against another player and if you lose, |Ryou will not be penalised in terms
of your experience or levels|w and you will lose none of your equipment.
For this reason, think of challenge as player kill refined into player
duelling.

Please don't abuse this feature by, for example, being spiteful towards
a player you may have killed. |WPKILL|w on some MUDS tends to make them very
nasty places, and on Xania the Immortals do not wish such unpleasantness to
exist.

See also: |Whelp duel|w and |Chelp challenge|w
~

0 DUEL~
Syntax: duel <character>

You will use this after you have prepared (i.e. 'spelled up') in the
preparation room. It will start a fight to the death. You will lose a duel
if you flee or if you are killed. If you are killed, you will be transferred
to the temple altar as if you had been killed under normal circumstances.
The victor can then walk safely out of the duelling pit.

See also: |Whelp pkill|w and |Chelp challenge|w
~


0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience. You need a varying
amount of experience to gain per level, depending on what sort of character
you have. The more creation points you score during the creation of your
character, the more experience required to level, and the minimum is
40 creation points -> 1000 experience per level.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~

-1 INTELLIGENT MOBS~
Certain mobiles on the MUD are smarter than others. A mob with this
intelligence, when attacked, will remember who the attacker was and will seek
revenge for a certain period of time......Beware of the those with an IQ
which is greater than their shoe size :) .

2/7/96: mobiles will now talk to you using a variety of responses! This is
        based on the early artificial intelligence program called 'Eliza'.
        The merc mud version was ported in C++ by C.Busch. The Xania mudchat
        database has been refined somewhat! If you have suggestions as to
        how certain mobs might talk to players, then make your suggestions
        in a note to immortal or leave a message in the Ideas news/mail
        system.
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after
the old one dies you may purcahse a replacement.

Pets will carry up to four items of equipment without complaining, and
these items will be saved when you quit out!
~



0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~



0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>
        cast <spell> brew
	cast <spell> scribe
	cast <spell> explosive
Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.

The use of 'brew' will create a potion, 'scribe' a scroll, or 'explosive'
a bomb! Note, this uses resources, so it will cost you gold to do so.
~
0 COLOR COLOUR~
Syntax: color

...toggles colour mode on and off.

The colour feature on |RX|w can be manipulated by players! In order to
make use of different colours, mainly when communicating, you must
send a control character |
      A colour code indicator must immediately follow the control
character. This is a list of all the codes which you can use.
(Note: the capital letter denotes a brighter, bolder equivalent!)

Code      Colour
----------------
w  W      White
c  C      Cyan
b  B      Blue
r  R      Red
g  G      Green
p  P      Purple/Magenta
y  Y      Yellow

Experiment with these, they're great fun!!
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <index>.<object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <index>.<object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.

When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'get n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, get 2.sword will buy the second. This works for drop, give and put too.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

0 NOTE NOTES~
The notes on Xania replace the bulletin boards and mail systems found on many
other muds.  The following options are usable:

reading notes:
note list	: show all notes (unread notes are marked with an N)
note read	: either by number, or read next to read unread notes
note remove	: removes a note that you wrote or are the target of

writing new notes:
note to		: sets the to line for a new note (name, immortal, or all)
note subject	: sets the subject for a new note
note +		: adds a line to a new note (i.e. note + hi guys!)
note - 		: removes last line from note
note clear	: erase a note in progress
note show	: shows the note you are working on
note post	: posts a new note. This MUST be done to post a note.

When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type
note read to scroll through them one at a time.
~
0 NEWS BULLETIN BOARD~
A facility new to Xania is the news system.  This system replaces the very
messy notes as a medium for discussion on the Mud.  Instead of many notes to
'all' about facilities, you can now post to the news base, which works in a
very similar way to USENET news on the Internet.  News is organised into
threads, which are like notes which have been grouped under a single
category.  Each 'note' within a thread is known as an article.
Using the news system is fairly self-explanatory :

|WReading news:|w
news next         : Show the next unread article in your current thread.  If
                    there are no more articles in the thread, note next will
                    automatically move onto the next unread thread
news read <num>   : Reads a specific article from within the current thread
news list         : Lists all of the threads, and their subjects
news thread <num> : Selects thread <num> as the current thread
news articles     : Shows a list of the articles within the current thread
news delete <num> : Deletes an article in the current thread, provided
                    you wrote the article
news skip         : Skip to the next thread, ignoring any articles left
                    in the current thread
news catchup      : Marks the whole currently selected thread as read
news uncatchup    : Marks the whole currently selected thread as unread

|WStarting a new thread:|w
news compose <subject> : Compose a new thread with the given subject

|WReplying to the currently selected thread:|w
news reply        : Replies to the currently selected thread

|WEditing your composition:|w
news + <line>     : Add <line> to your current composition
news -            : Remove a line from your composition
news show         : Display your composition
news post         : Complete your composition and add it into the news base
news clear        : Abandon your composition

For those people using clients that expand 'news' into north, east, west and
south, you may use the synonym 'mail'
~
0 MAIL~
The mail command is a synonym for news, and has exactly the same syntax.  It
is purely for people who's MUD clients expand the 'news' command into the
directional commands 'north, east, west, south'

See help |cnews|w.
~
92 IMMNEWS~
In addition to the mortal news commands, IMMs have a few more facilities :
news flags <flaglist>  : Changes the flags on the current thread.  To get
                         a list of possible flags, omit the <flaglist>
news expiry (98+ only) : Sets the expiry time (in days) of a thread
news from   (98+ only) : Sets the 'from' field of a message
~
0 SCAN~
Scan is a useful command which permits you to look around to locate any
nearby mobs or players. It gets better as your level increases.
~
0 PROMPT~

PROMPT ON
PROMPT OFF
PROMPT <%*>
You can program you prompt using the following commands:

PROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.

   %h :  Display your current hits
   %H :  Display your maximum hits
   %m :  Display your current mana
   %M :  Display your maximum mana
   %v :  Display your current moves
   %V :  Display your maximum moves

   %R :  Display the vnum you are in      (|RIMMORTAL|w ONLY)
   %z :  Display the area name you are in (|RIMMORTAL|w ONLY)
~
0 AUCTION GOSSIP . SHOUT YELL PHILOSOPHISE ALLEGE GRATZ MUSIC ANNOUNCE CHANNELS~
Syntax: auction      <message>
Syntax: gossip       <message>   or  . <message>
Syntax: shout        <message>
Syntax: yell         <message>
Syntax: philosophise <message>
Syntax: allege       <message>
Syntax: gratz        <message>
Syntax: music        <message>
Syntax: qwest        <message>  

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.

AUCTION and GOSSIP are variants of SHOUT (without the delay).  '.' is a synonym
for CHAT.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

Type a channel name by itself to turn it off.

ANNOUNCE is a public channel which will display various bits of information,
for example, if somebody raises a level, is killed, or if they go away
from their keyboard (along with their explanation for doing so, if they
provide one - see help afk).
~

0 EMOTE , POSE SOCIAL~
Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK.

POSE is a variant of EMOTE.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.
~


0 BUG IDEA TYPO~
Syntax: bug <message>
Syntax: idea <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~

0 CREDITS~
Syntax: credits

This command shows the list of the original Diku Mud implementors.
~

0 AREAS~
Syntax: areas [min level [max level]]

AREAS shows you a list of areas in the game.  
You may optionally specify a minimum and maximum level: to find all areas 
for level 40 and above type
'areas 40' 
and to find areas suitable for levels 10-20 type 
'areas 10 20'.

Areas are now colour-coded if you have ANSI colour enabled - bright cyan
levels are suitable for all, or are special in some way.  Bright white areas 
are areas appropriate for your level (+/- 3 levels), all other levels are 
probably too low level or too high level for you.
~

0 COMMANDS REPORT SCORE TIME~
Syntax: commands
Syntax: report
Syntax: score
Syntax: time
Syntax: weather

COMMANDS shows you all the commands in the game.

REPORT shows your current statistics to you and also announces them to other
players in the room.  SCORE shows much more detailed statistics to you only.
Your ability scores are shown as true value(current value), so for example
Str: 15(23) means you have a 15 strength from training, but a 23 strength
from other factors (spells or items).

TIME shows the game time, as well as the time the mud was last started,
and the current local time for the host computer.  If you have a personal
timezone set, it will also show you your own local time.

WEATHER shows the current game weather.
~

0 TIMEZONE~
The 'timezone' command allows you to specify your own local time, as an
offset from GMT.  The default time shown will be British time, which will
include the 1-hour offset during Summer.  Your timezone will be used in
addition to the normal times in the 'time' command, and will also be used
in your prompt if you are using the '%t' (show current time) token.

Syntax:
   timezone 2:36         Sets your time offset to 2 hours and 36 mins
   timezone              Unsets your time offset (forces British time)

Related help:
   help time
   help prompt
~


0 WHO~
Syntax: who
Syntax: who <level-range>
Syntax: who <class or race>
Syntax: who <class or race> <level-range>

Syntax: who <clan name> : for CLANS see also help CLANWHO

Syntax: whois <player name>

WHO shows the people currently in the game.  Some people may choose to
remain unseen and won't appear on the WHO

WHO without any arguments shows all of the (visible) people currently playing.

With arguments, WHO can show players of certain classes, levels or clan.
For example:

who 10          lists all players of level 10 or above
who 15 20       lists all players between level 15 and 20
who cleric      lists all clerics playing
who immortal    lists all immortals playing
who cleric 1 5  lists all clerics between levels 1 and 5
who elf cleric  lists all elven clerics
who brother     lists all members of the 'brother' clan
who brot 10 20  lists all members of the 'brother' clan between levels 10-20

Classes, races and clan names may be abbreviated.
~

0 WHERE~
Syntax: where
Syntax: where <character>

WHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the same
area as you are.

WHERE with an argument tells you the location of one character with that name
within your area, including monsters.
~

0 HELP~
Syntax: help
Syntax: help <keyword>

HELP without any arguments shows a one-page command summary.

HELP <keyword> shows a page of help on that keyword.  The keywords include
all the commands, spells, and skills listed in the game.
~

0 DESCRIPTION DESC~
Syntax: description <string>
        description + <string>
        description - 
Sets your long description to the given string.  If the description string
starts with a '+', the part after the '+' is appended to your current
description, so that you can make multi-line descriptions.

Oddly enough, description - will delete a line!
~

0 PASSWORD~
Syntax: password <old-password> <new-password>

PASSWORD changes your character's password.  The first argument must be
your old password.  The second argument is your new password.

The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged.
~

0 TITLE~
Syntax: title <string>

Sets your title to a given string.

The game supplies a title when your character is created and when you
advance a level.  You can use TITLE to set your title to something else.
~

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy.
~

0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK~
Syntax: open   <object|direction>
Syntax: close  <object|direction>
Syntax: lock   <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock <object|direction>
Syntax: pick   <object|direction>

OPEN and CLOSE open and close an object or a door.

LOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have
the requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.

PICK can open a lock without having the key.  In order to PICK successfully,
you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 DRINK EAT FILL POUR~
Syntax: drink <object>
Syntax: eat   <object>
Syntax: fill  <object>
Syntax: pour  <container>
        pour  <container> <player>
        pour  <container> in <container2> 

When you are thirsty, DRINK something.

When you are hungry, EAT something.

FILL fills a drink container with water.

Pour can be used to empty a container, fill one carried by another player or
pour |Win|w to another of your own. 
~

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: buy   <index>.<object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second.

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.
~

0 SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to your Alander, who may reward you.
The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.
~

0 SCROLL~
Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the
default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.

For REALLY HIGH level players (level 80+), CONSIDER also gives you a fairly
complete identification of the character (i.e. health points).
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
~

0 VISIBLE~
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 QUIT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

Objects which are greater than two levels above you will not be kept.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL
        'RECALL CLAN'

RECALL prays to the Gods for miraculous transportation from where you
are back to main city.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not
insure success.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.

With the argument 'clan', a member of a clan may be teleported back to his
or her central clan room.
~

0 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <amount>

SPLIT splits some gold between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the gold after a kill.
~

0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.

There are penalties for using STEAL on other players.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.
~

92 COMA AWAKEN~
Syntax: coma <target>
	awaken <target>

These commands reciprocate each other and can be used to force a permanent
sleep upon a mob or player.

~

100 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

100 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~
100 SACNAME~
Syntax: sacname <name>

This fun command allows the name to which items will be sacrificed
to be altered.
~

98 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN PERMIT~
Syntax: allow   <site>
        ban     <site> <type>
        permban <site> <type>
        permban
        ban
        permit <player>


ban and permban allow restrictions on the sites that can connect to Xania.
All bans are temporary and take effect only until the Mud shuts down,
whereas permbans are permanent.  

The site name can be wildcarded, so '*.demon.co.uk' prevents all demon users
from using Xania, and 'ws101.*' bans anyone using a machine called 'ws101'.

The type of bans are:
   all     - which prevents any players from that site from connecting
   newbies - which just prevents new characters from connecting
   permit  - which bans all players from that site, except any existing
             players who have been explicitly allowed using the permit
             command

The permit command takes a player name as a parameter; if this is prepended
with a '-' character then that character's permit privilege is revoked.
~

99 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

Never, ever, shutdown the mud.
~


96 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to Rivers of Mud.  Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 91), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to Alander.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~

99 DENY~
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
~

97 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect   <name>
Syntax: disconnect + <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.

Disconnect + is used to get rid of players who are not actually in the mud
but are connected and listed on 'sockets'. Rather than searching through
the active players, it looks through those connected via the descriptor
list.
~

97 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a
troublemaker is usually a better option than the deny command.
~

93 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 97 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

96 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name>

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The output also displays the masked source IP address of the client, along with
a unique number generated from that address. This enables you to spot characters
connected from the same IP address without revealing the full address.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~

96 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~

98 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)

To read the current state of flags on extra and wear flags on objects, and
room flags, use 'set obj <obj> extra ?' or similar.
~

0 SETINFO~
This command is used to set information about yourself. Other characters can
see this information when they use the finger command with your character name.

The usage is as follows:
setinfo			Shows the current settings.
setinfo name <Name>	Sets the name field to 'Name'.
setinfo email <Email>	Sets the email field to 'Email'.
setinfo url <URL>	Sets the url field to 'URL'.
setinfo message <Mes>	Sets the mesage field to <Mes>.
setinfo show name||email||url||message
			Makes the respective field showable to other

~

98 FLAGS~
The flags system has been revised on Xania.  Instead of remembering all
those horrible powers of two and adding them up, symbolic names have now
been assigned to all settable flags.  The general syntax of any set command
is now:
 
set <type> <thing> flags ?           - to list the current flags, and all
                                       possible flags settable
set <type> <thing> flags <flag list> - where flag list is defined below

Where flag list consists of a space  separated list of flags, which can also
have '+' or '-' prepended to them.  By default, the state of a flag is
toggled, but with a '+' prepended, the flag is set, and similarly with '-'
it is cleared.  For example :

set object dagger extra +glow +hum -nodrop evil

...will set glow and hum, clear the nodrop flag and toggle the current state
of the evil flag.
~

95 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~

94 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
Syntax: nochannel  <character>
	noemote    <character>
	noshout    <character>
	notell     <character>
        noclanchan <clan member>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, auction, Q/A, music) on the game.
It will also prevent people from sending messages using the AFK command.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~

97 PARDON~
Syntax: pardon <character> killer
	pardon <character> thief

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.  Being killed by Hassan acts as an automatic
pardon.
~

95 PRIVATE~
Just type private in a room and it will be given the private status
immediately. It can be switched off by anyone with this command inside
the room.
~

96 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~

96 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~

97 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~

95 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer.
~

94 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

94 ECHO GECHO PECHO ZECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
        zecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo. Zecho will send a message to the area you are currently in, 
which can be handy for localised quests. 
~

92 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.
~

93 HOLYLIGHT INVIS PROWL~
Syntax: holylight
	winvis <level>
        prowl <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 100 characters are totally
invisible.

Prowl is similar to Wizinvis, except that those below your level of prowl will
only see you when you are in the same room as them. This is useful for sneaking
around.
~

93 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~

96 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~

93 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat obj  <vnum>
	stat room <number>
	stat <skills/spells/info/pracs/affects> <player>
	stat prog <name>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Specifying a vnum with stat obj will provide some info on
the object template but is not as thorough as stating an object by name.

stat prog will give you a listing of a mobprog.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

92 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
Place names inside single quotes if there is more than one word.
The name needs to be at least 2 characters long.

If you want to see where all players are, don't specify a name.

~
92 OWHERE~
Syntax: owhere <object name>

This will help you find objects! Place names inside single quotes if there
is more than one word.
~

92 OSEARCH~
Syntax: osearch [min level] [max level] [item type] optional item name...

This searches for items in the item database, not the object instances in world!
You must provide min/max level range and an item type name.
You can optionally filter on the leading part of the object name.
As some items are level 0, specifing min level 0 is allowed.
e.g.
   osearch 5 10 weapon flail
   osearch 5 10 light
~

95 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobs, and deletes the sentient victim name.
~

92 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: poofout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

95 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to Alander.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell Alander.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

94 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
	return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
~

91 IMMTALK :~
Syntax: immtalk <message>
	immtalk

Immtalk sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for immtalk.
Using this command with no argument turns off the immortal channel (or
turns it back on).
~
91 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

Wizhelp provides a list of all the immortal commands.
~
92 WIZNET~
Syntax: wiznet
        wiznet <on/off/bug/debug/immortal/mortal/tick>

Wiznet allows IMMs to monitor the MUD in a reasonably user-friendly
manner.  On its own, typing wiznet will tell you if wiznet is on, and
which wiznet channels are activated.
Any other wiznet command toggles the monitoring state of that channel,
ie 'wiznet mortal' toggles your wiznet mortal channel monitoring.  A
list of the channels follows:

  mortal                    - All mortal logged commands such as
                              order, outfit and clan commands.
  immortal                  - All immortal commands executed by
                              players the same or lower level than
                              you.
  bug                       - Bugs reported by the MUD code.
  debug                     - Low-level debugging diagnostics,
                              basically all other strings being sent to
                              the logfile.  Only IMMs of level 96 and
                              above will actually see this information.
  tick                      - Time-keeping TICK log line.

~

0 AFK 'AWAY FROM KEYBOARD' SHOWAFK~
Syntax: afk
	afk <string>
	showafk
Use AFK when you are going to be unavailable. This lets everyone else know
that you're not around.
If you add a string, this will be a short explanation of what you are
doing or how long you will be eg. "<char_name is> washing his hair."

In addition, when you go afk and return to your keyboard, it is made clear
to other players via the announce channel.

Showafk is a feature that will show any tells to you and the time when they
were made if this is switched on. Do auto to find out whether it is on or
not.
~

0 THROW~

by 20 points.

target character by +1 each.
~


0 BLINDNESS~
Syntax: cast blindness <victim>

This spell renders the target character blind.
~

0 BOMB EXPLOSIVES~
Syntax: cast '<spellname>' explosive

Bomb making is a cunning trick used to weaken mobs. You hands must be
empty in order to create a bomb and from then on, up to three additional
spell may be added to it. There is increasing risk of the bomb detonating
as you attempt to apply more spells to it. Note, manufacturing a bomb
uses resources, so it will cost you gold to do so.

Bombs can be detonated by throwing them at mobs at the start of combat.

Only mages have the necessary alchemical skills to create bombs.

If you want to use the identify spell on a bomb, use 'bomb' as the keyword:
using 'explosive' as the keyword will create a new bomb, of 'identify' !

more damage.

This evil spell will cause your weapon to spread terrible plagues,
so try not to use it in civilised areas!

energy. The chief advantage of this spell is that it can stop mobs being
aggressive and/or sentient for a period of time.

Someone affected by calm will, during combat, hit less often and with less
effect, due to their reduced metabolic rate.
~


0 'CALL LIGHTNING'~

~
0 'DISPEL MAGIC' CANCELLATION~
Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
        cast 'cancellation' <character>

Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.  Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considering an attack spell.
Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.

The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.
~

0 EARTHQUAKE~
Syntax: cast 'earthquake'

This spell inflicts damage on every enemy character in the room.
Beware that other characters who are not yet fighting may attack

0 'ENCHANT WEAPON'~
Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon>
	cast 'enchant weapon' <armour>

This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its to-hit and to-dam
bonuses by one or two points.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the
weapon grows more and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or
destroyed by the magic.  Also, every successful enchant increases the level
of the weapon my one...and there is no turning back.

If cast upon armour, hit and damage points will be applied to the armour.
If the object is below level 50, it will will immediately become level 50.
The level of the armour will increase by one, as normal.
~

-1 'ENCHANT ARMOR'~
The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magics. It is
not nearly as reliable as enchant weapon, being far more prone to destructive
effects.  Each succesful enchant increases the plus of the armor by 1 or 2
points, and raises its level by one.
~

0 'ENERGY DRAIN'~
Syntax: cast 'energy drain' <victim>

This spell saps the experience points, mana, and movement points of its
target.
~

including the caster.
~

0 INSANITY~

to be inflicted.

0 'PASS DOOR'~
Syntax: cast 'pass door'

This spell enables the caster to pass through closed doors.
~


0 PORTAL~
Syntax: cast portal <target>

Portal is a more powerful version of the Gate spell. It will sustain
a gateway to another place for a varying length of time, depending
upon the level of the caster. Portals are static objects, they
cannot be moved or destroyed.

Portals cannot be used in areas of the world designated as safe and lawful.
Not everybody is permitted to walk through a portal, aggressive mobs,
for example.

You use the 'enter portal' command to go through a portal. Members of
your group, including pets, will automatically follow you through a
portal as long as they can see it. 
~

0 POTION POTIONS SCROLL SCROLLS BREW SCRIBE~
Syntax: cast '<spellname>' brew
	cast '<spellname>' scribe

You can cast a spell into the form of either a potion or scroll. This
allows you to use the spell at a later date, eg. during combat. The cost

mages and clerics have this ability.

Potions are 'quaffed' and scrolls 'recited'.

~
0 'PROTECT CONTAINER'~

~

0 'PSYCHIC TORNADO'~
Syntax: cast 'psychic tornado' <character>

Masters of the elements can have the powerful ability to form a tornado
using raw, psychic energy. Casting this spell upon a mob will unleash
a mighty psychic blast upon them, forming a swirling tornado at the same
time. This vortex of psychic energy may make mobiles and players in the
vicinity sick and disorientated. There is a chance that the target will be
sucked into the tornado and carried helplessly away! Beware, for this
spell is powerful and has been known to backfire occassionally...
~

This spell refreshes the movement points of a character who is out of movement
points.

0 REGENERATION~
Syntax: cast regeneration <character>

This spell will accelerate the rate at which hit points are restored.
~



0 'REMOVE ALIGNMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'remove alignment' <object>

This spell removes the inhibitions of alignment from an object. The caster's
level has a bearing on the success of the spell, i.e. if their level is
well below that of the object, the likelihood of failure is increased.

Objects made of weaker materials are more likely to explode under the 
force of the spell.
~



0 'REMOVE CURSE'~
Syntax: cast 'remove curse' <character>

This spell removes a curse from a character.
~
0 'REMOVE INVIS'~
Syntax: cast 'remove invis' <object>

class.  SHIELD provides 20 points of armor.  STONE SKIN provides 40 points of

93 SMITE~
The immortals of Xania are holders of immense power, and every so often
it is necessary to unleash this power in order to chastise mortals or
mobiles who are acting out of line :)

Don't overindulge in your use of smite, as it is very powerful and potentially
very annoying for your mortal victim. It can be handy to remove aggie mobs
swiftly too.
~


0 PREFIX~
The prefix command is designed to make life easier.  Instead of having to
type the same string (ie "Tell Someone ") over and over, you can use the
command 'prefix' to automatically add the prefix to each command you type.

Syntax:
    prefix                  (with no argument, turns prefix off)
    prefix tell someone     (sets the prefix to 'tell someone')

If the prefix is set, you can type...
    \<something>            (reads <something> without the prefix)
    \\<something>           (as with single \, but also switches prefix off)

Note that you can add your current prefix to your prompt (type 'help
prompt').
~


0 DONATE~
The donate command allows you to place an item into the pit in the Temple
of Isca when you are not actually in the Temple yourself.  This is made
possible by using the psychic field which has been set up due to the large
concentration of Gods in the land of Xania.  Unfortunately, since the psychic
flux spirals toward the Altar in the Temple, it is only possible to make
transfers one-way, so it is impossible to take items from the pit by this
psychic method (although, of course, you can still take them out of the pit
normally).

Due to the violent confusion of flux near to the Temple, some items may
be too flimsy to be transferred - they would simply be torn apart by the
vortices.

Syntax:
    donate <something>      (puts <something> into the pit in the Temple of
                             Isca)
~


0 ALIST~
Xania on-line creation utilities.

Syntax:  alist

This command lists all areas and related information.
~

0 TIPWIZARD TIPS~

Syntax:
	tips
	tips {on/off}

Xania helps you by providing a Tip Wizard which frequently tells you 
about useful commands and facts about the MUD.  The current version
of the Tip Wizard is aimed at players who are new to the game although
an 'advanced' version may also become available later.  Typing 'tips'
by itself toggles the current setting.
~

0 HAILCORPSE HC~

Syntax:
	hailcorpse
	hc

The Gods of Xania bestowed the powers of Necromantic Restoration upon
several Iscarian High Clerics long ago. Today, traces of these powers remain
in all citizens of Xania in the guise of a divine skill known
as hailcorpse.

In the unfortunate event of being slain, travel to a location very
near to where your corpse lies. Then incant the Sacred Verses of
Necrosis and your corpse will be summoned. Use caution as incanting
the Sacred Verses of Necrosis can take some time, leaving you exposed
to hazards. You can hail your corpse if it has become trapped in a
particularly dangerous place.
