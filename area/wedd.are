|YThe Golden Walkway|w~
I hope that you don't suffer from vertigo, for having ascended the
rainbow bridge and headed north, you have walked halfway across a
narrow, golden walkway which does not appear to be supported by
anything. It is just floating in the clouds below Asgard! You gaze
over the perilous edge and see Midgaard's Combat Arena, the viewing
gallery which overlooks it and the Altar of Isca. The domed temple to
the north of the walkway is an impressive site but you notice that the
temple entrance is enclosed by a small shop. You may either enter the
shop, or head back south; don't attempt to bungee-jump off the bridge 
down to the duelling pit!

Moss Bros~
The entrance to Wedding Rites is taken up by a small branch of Moss
Bros. Before you can even draw breath an outfitter rushes over and
trys to sell you some clothes from his list of wedding paraphenalia.  
He is wearing the grey morning suit, complete with top hat and tails 
that he hopes you will buy from him.  To the north you can see a huge 
temple looming over the top of the shops roof.  The path leads north, 
through some huge brass doors, to the temple and back to the south.

Temple of Holy Rites~
The Temple of Holy Rites opens before you.  Intricately carved stone 
|Cpillars|w reach ever upwards towards the heavens.  Vast Norman
|Carches|w defy gravity itself, their splendour matching the pillars
they top.  You gasp in awe at this wondrous stonemasonry, only the race
of Giants could have built something so huge and at the same time 
so beautiful.  Moving past the open doors you see rows of carved
wooden |Cpews|w that are inlayed in precious metals.  To the far end 
of this almost infinite room stands an impressive marble |Caltar|w.  
Just before you get to the altar you notice a small iron |Cgrate|w set
into the floor.  It seems out of place amongst such architecture.  The 
temple leads east to the reception area or south out of the temple.

pillars~
The pillars are made out of grey granite hewn from UnderDark.  They
are delicately carved with images of cherubim and seraphim amidst a
sea of intricate patterns.

The arches span vast distances.  They too are made from carved granite blocks.

pews wooden seating~
Wooden seating carved with both holy and mystical images are arranged 
into almost never ending rows.  Gold and silver has been inlayed into
the patterns.
~

E
altar marble~
The black marble altar stands five foot  high and stretches as far as
the eye can see. Unlike the stonework making up the pillars it is not
carved or decorated.  Adorning the altar is a cover made from the
finest silk, on which rests a large leather bound ledger with the
words Xad's Registry Book embossed in gold leaf on the front.

The grate set into the floor is made of thick, black iron bars. It 
blocks the entry to a rather dark looking pit ...

Reception Dance Floor~
A large parquet floor made from maple and walnut stretches off into
the distance. To your left, behind a pair of revolving turntables,
stands a |CDJ|w who is playing all the latest hits from Lurve FM.  
The sound is deafening and you cannot hear yourself think.  
Holding your hands to your ears you realise that this was a bad
mistake as light reflecting off the overhead spinning |Cglitterball|w 
dazzles you.  Ahead across the dance floor to the north is the
sanctuary of the buffet/bar, whilst the temple you have just left is
to your west.

A hobbit wearing the latest in high fashion is rifling through boxes
of records. He takes requests, not that he listens to what you ask
for.  He plays the music that he likes and hopes you do too, but its

E
glitterball~
Originally designed as an instrument of torture by the demons of hell,
the glitterball has found its way into the pubs and clubs of Xania.  
Its magical property of being able to reflect and intensify any light 
shone on it led to it being banned from Death's bedroom by Faramir who
found he could not get any sleep in his room because of it.  
Unfortunately, Death, TheMoog, Wandera, Rohan and LuxoR used to enjoy
watching the spinning globe.  So Faramir had to create road works just
so that they could use those little flashing yellow lights you find
there in its place.

#205
Buffet Bar~
Seeing the bar you start to feel a lot happier.  People you don't
recognise are propping up the bar, now whose relations are those?  As 
per usual for a wedding, more people have been invited to drink and
eat you out of house and home at the reception than were invited to
the actual ceremony.  Fighting your way to the front of the queue you
see that standing behind the bar is a very bored barman.  He starts to
fidget and adjust his tie as he feels your eyes upon him.  In the
corner of the room is a winding staircase that leads upstairs.  A
route back to the dance floor is to the south.

Divorce Hell~
You have entered a dark, cold crypt.  What little light there is
illuminates a |Cwoman|w who is trying to hide in the shadows. This 
is where you have to come to destroy the beauty that is marriage. 
The damp air chills your bones and you vow never to return to this
desolate place.  Brrr!  The grate you climbed down through is 
swinging behind you and you quickly make a beeline for it.

The Balcony~
The Balcony looks down onto the top of the Temple of Holy Rites.  A 
huge brass dome is situated above where the altar would be.  Truly it
is a magnificent building. From up here Xania is spread out below you
as if on a map.  In the distance you can just make out a flying
citadel as it breaks out of some cloud.  At night time couples come
here to gaze at the moonlit heavens and count the stars.  Ivy has
managed to entwine itself around the balcony railings so making it
look as if it is alive.  After the hustle and bustle of downstairs you
are glad for the peace and solitude. The chance to be alone together.
The only exit from this idyllic setting is back down to the bar.
