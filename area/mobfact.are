Entrance to the Mob Factory~
You find that you have entered a strange factory. This factory doesn't
make cars or computers or something - it makes mobs! The sound of
machinery can be heard in the background; the grinding gears drive you
crazy! To the north you see the storage area, to the south the
foreman's office, to the east the entrance hallway, and to the west the
familiar paving of wall road.

Mob Factory Storage Area~
This is where the raw materials from which mobs are manufactured are
stored. You see sacks of sawdust, cans of pink paint, a large box
containing wigs and a bottle mysteriously labelled "solution x". Exits
are more of storage to the east and north, and entrance to the mob
factory to the south.

Foreman's Bathroom~
This is the place where the foreman makes frequent visits. The smell
here is very strong and reminds you of bovine excrement! There is a
shower to the back, and a urinal to the left. On the floor you can
see stains of a very suspicious nature. The only exit leads north to
the foreman's office.

Entrance Hallway to Mob Factoy~

eyes is observing you...... Exits are north to the storage area, east
to the entrance hallway, south to the cafeteria and west to the mob
factory entrance.

You find that you have entered the cafeteria of the mob factory. There

seem to care. There are many places where food and drink have been
spilled on the ground. Exits are north to the entrance hallway and
