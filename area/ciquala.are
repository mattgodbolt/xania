A large knothole in a tree
         << Warning, downwards is a HIGH level area!>>~
You stand in a cramped space inside an old, gnarled tree.  A frigid 
breeze rises from the ground.

A dusty tunnel deep under the ground~
You stand in a tunnel that appears to have been dug out of the dirt.
You do not understand what is keeping the tunnel walls from caving in.  This
would probably be a very bad place to use a dispel magic spell!  You do see 
some footprints in the dust, and looking up, you see who they belong to!

A room with a large pool of water in the center~
This room has a large pool of black water in the center.  You see
many runes and glyphs surrounding it.  The room is lit by torches held in 
sconces.  Each of these items in the room merits more investigation.

runes~
These runes are carved into the rock about the pool.  You think you
recognize the rune of vision, and another that has something to do with 
projecting power at a distance.
~

glyphs~
The glyphs are drawn upon the stone with what appears to be blood.  
You do not recognize any of them, and it would probably be a good idea not to
touch any of them.
~
E
sconces~
The sconces are black and shaped liked two hands, cradling the torches
between their pointed nails.
~
E
torches~
The torches are made of a black wood, and as you draw nearer, you find
that they do not emit any heat.  Indeed, they seem to be radiating cold.  The
flames are an icy blue, that makes you think twice about getting too close to 
them.
~
E
pool~
As you lean forward and look in the pool, you see nothing but the dark
murky water.  Gradually though, an image forms before you.  You recognize the
person the image shows.  It is the Avatar!  Apparently this is a pool that 
Ciquala uses to scry upon her enemies.
	The image is so clear, you almost believe you could step into the pool,
and appear in Lord British's castle.

The Laboratory of Ciquala~
This room is lined with shelves that contain a multitude of jars, 
boxes, vials, chests, tubes, glasses, beakers, and other assorted containers.
You think that drinking the contents of any might have undesireable effects.

Supply room~
This supply room keeps many of the items that are too large to fit in
the laboratory itself.  You see several corpses that are preserved by the 
ever-present cold that you have encountered in every room in this tunnel 
system.  Also several crates hold contents, whose scent is enought to make
you wish to shut the door immediately.  You believe that you hear a noise
from behind one of the crates.

The Map Room~
This room is filled with maps, apparently containing some of Ciquala's
plans.  You notice many maps of Lord British's castle.  You might be able to
gain some information on Ciquala's plans, as well as learn your way through
British's castle if you examine the map more closely.

Storage Room~

The Room of the Automatons~
You gasp as you realize that these pasty faced people do not seem to 
have a will of their own.  No doubt the work of the Lich.  If these
monstrosities are allowed to escape into the world, they will cause no end
of problems for Xania.

Entrance to Ciquala's Throne Room~
This does not look like any of the other rooms you have been in up till
now.  The ceiling rises a full 40 feet in the air above you.  The walls are 
covered with murals proclaiming the might and majesty of Ciquala.  She does
not look old and decayed as you would have pictured her.  Instead, she looks 
rather regal and stately, but undoubtedly evil.

This room is clothed in darkness, and a chill eminates from the foul
monarch of the undead.  A large tapestry hangs behind her throne.  The ceiling
rises above you, hidden in the darkness beyond the range your light can
penetrate.  A feeling of hopelessness and insignificance overwhelms you as you
face the Lich, Ciquala!

piles of coins that cover the floor.  A large paving stone in this room seems
