Troll's Larder~
This room has blood and grime all over the walls.  You see maggots and other
insects crawling up them.  The resident is definitely uncivilized.  Half-eaten
and rotting body parts scatter the floor, each having its own colony of flies,
worms, and maggots.

as they bore new holes into a corpse laying on the far wall of the west room.

The Playpen~
The walls are covered with blood (and body parts!?!?).  Plastered on the far
wall you see what looks like a human arm.  A half-eaten body lies here with
its chest ripped out.  The predator seems disinterested in it.

arm rotting~
This reminds you of what a baby would do to its formula during dinnertime,
plastering it on the wall.

#2805
Troll's Bedroom~
Obviously something REALLY big lives here.  The stench is quite unbearable.
There are piles and piles of rotten and half-eaten body parts of animals,
orcs, (and humans?) strewn across the floor.  There is a larger, more
prominent pile of rotten parts over in a corner.  It seems to have been
flattened by something.
