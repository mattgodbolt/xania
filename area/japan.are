The Island Shore~
You are on the shore of a rocky island, the coastline of which stretches as
far as you can see to the north and south.  To the west, the shimmmering 
waters of a huge sea stretch forever into the horzion.  In the distance to
the northeast rises a giant snow-capped peak, larger than any you have ever
seen before.  A smooth stone path winds off through the rocky terrain to the
east, away from the sea.

A Smooth Stone Path~
You are on a smooth path which winds east and west through the rocky terrain
of this island.  You see that the path is made up of tiny stones, which have
been masterfully assembled to make a smooth walkway, with only hair-thin
cracks to indicate it is not one giant piece of solid rock.  You wonder what
kind of people inhabit this land, to spend so much time and effort to make
something as simple as a path into perfection.  A shimmmering sea lies off
