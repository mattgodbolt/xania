The Beaten Trail~
You are heading along an undulating pathway which runs east to west.
Some grassy plains lie in the west whilst the dark shadow of tree
covered hills lie in the east. In the distance, beyond the hills you
can make out the snow capped peaks of some mist covered mountains.

The trail through the steep wooded hills~
Tall, coniferous woodlands lie to the north and south of this dirt
track, which continues to lead a way between the east and west.
Although the trees shadow the track in darkness, you feel particularly
exposed, especially as the trail is not perfectly straight. If anyone,
or rather, anything, were to come round a bend or over a hill, they would
see you immediately. Somehow, the cover of the trees seem like a good idea...

The dark, undulating trail~
The path rolls up and down over steep foothills, which appear to
diminish in height in the west. Much further in the west is the
imposing line of the Misty Mountains. The darkness of the trees
to the north and south offer you shelter from the elements, and
indeed, from any enemies you may encounter.

You stand upon a worn pathway which heads west through some dark,

river bed and then you notice the silver snake of the river Bruinen
which heads between the north and south. The beautiful, yet fearful
Misty Mountains stand regally in the far east.

You slide down the slope to the south of the trail into the security
of the undergrowth. There is no lower canopy of vegetation here, as
the tall trees have blocked out all of the light, preventing the
growth of any other species. The thick layer of pine needles on the
ground would be comfortable to lie upon though. Perhaps you should
take a break from the perils of the road.

The hardpacked sand of a dried river bed crunches beneath your feet.
The sand spreads out to the north, south and over to the east where
you can hear and smell the presence of a river, beyond which lie the
Misty Mountains. Some forested hills spring up to your west, and you
can see a trail winding up into them.

On the shoreline of the river Bruinen~
Your feet make well defined prints in the sand which borders the river
Bruinen. This wide, clear river glides its way south into uncharted
lands and acts as a natural barrier, protecting the lands to the east.
It appears that there is a ford across the river here, whilst the
dried bed, indicating the path which the river formerly took, lies to
the north and southwest.

You head further south across the land where the river Bruinen once

rotting corpses of amphibious creatures. The steep land in the west
swings around to the south and makes further progress in that
direction impossible. You consider jumping in the fast flowing river
to the east, or you can head back north again.

You enter the river Bruinen. The spray of water is FREEZING cold, and
who knows what beasts may lurk beneath the surface, waiting to gobble
you up?! You were far safer on land and besides the flow heading
southwards is far too strong for you to fight. You suddenly notice that
the wind has whipped up too, causing the river to forge along at a
tremendous pace. It looks like you don't have much choice but to let the
flow take you....

Caught in a viscious whirlpool~
The river and the wind fury into an insane rage, taking you
faster and faster over the rapids of the Bruinen. You are soaked to
the skin by the icy water and thoroughly demoralised by your total
helplessness.

Entering this river was a |RBAD|w decision. After all, it has been
enhanced magically by a great wizard, with the intention of keeping
out daemons who have far greater power than you! Take a hint!

Suddenly, by pure chance, the swirling elements
catch you in a whirlpool and giving you one chance to save your
own skin before you drown....you might like to consider RECALLing out
of here....

Ford across the river~
You are standing in in the middle of a ford across the icy river
Bruinen. Its clear, rippling waters scatter reflections of the
lands around, particularly of the Misty Mountains in the east.
This ford is the one and only gateway to Imladris. Dark, ominous
hills lie in the west and it is possible to enter the river as it
goes on it southerly course.

defensive capabilities. Mountains loom in the east and you can see
clusters of small buildings amidst trees nearby.
A sign stands here prominently.

through Imladris. To the north and south stand closely clustered
trees, amongst which homes have been constructed. The beautiful
scent of flowers fills the air and ornate vines hang down from
the branches which reach over, far above your head.

In the distance you can hear the beautiful sound of elves singing
intricate harmonies.

This beautiful, tree-lined pathway heads westwards through Imladris
and turns north towards a water well which you can see in the
distance. A large tree stands here on the corner, reaching out
huge branches and the multitude of leaves appear to radiate every colour
of the rainbow. You suddenly realise that this great tree is a
'Mallorn', one of the finest and indeed, rarest trees in the world.
It's presence fills you with a tremendous feeling of goodness and it
is only then that you notice the fact that most of the lengthy branches
are pointing towards the gardens to the south.

This is one of the mighty Mallorns. The great strengths and virtuous

remaining cluster of such trees stand in the forest of Lothlorien, in

The Well of Elbereth~
Before you stands a stout well of smooth grey stone. This must be a

qualities of the local water. From rumours you have heard in the
past, the water which flows out of the Misty Mountains into Imladris
is some of the finest in the world. A path heads southwards, or you
can go east along the way of Nimrodel.

Although the trees arch over and block out much of the light, Nimrodel

stands in the west, whilst the way of Nimrodel continues east.
For a moment you see faces amongst the trees to the north and south.

Amongst the shadows of the trees~
You walk amidst towering trees, typical of Imladris. They are widely
varied, with trunks of brown, mossed over with fuzzy green lichen
and the thin, silvery white Poplars, streaked with black gashes. It
seems odd that such a range of trees could grow in one place - surely
the soil is not capable of sustaining so many! The chirp of birdlife
sprinkles the cool air and you step as lightly as possible, lest your
tramping feet spoil the purity of this place.

High up in the trees~
You stand inside an Elven Dwelling, a great distance from the forest
floor. Mysterious shadows flicker about the room and the sound of
birdsong floats on the refreshing, scented air. A huge, circular,
wooden tub held together by large bands of iron sits in the centre
of the room, filled with steaming hot water. This looks like an ideal
opportunity for a bath, but quite how an elf managed to get so much
hot water up inside a treehouse is beyond you....

The Smithy~
This is the workshop of the elf who is skilled in the art of metalwork.
A huge brazier sits in the corner of this dark, sweltering hut which
has been built of large beams of wood covered in straw thatching. A
metal pipe runs up from the brazier out through the centre of the roof
to act as a chimney for the fumes. The hard flagstones support
an iron anvil which sits in the centre of the room beside a stool.
Racks and shelves line the walls, littered with tools and a varied
selection of metal items which are still undergoing the process of
construction. Nimrodel Way runs it's course to the north.

The Tanner~
You stand in the workshop of an elf who is skilled with animal hides. 
The presence of a tanner surprises you, for you had always assumed that 
elves used materials which were more ecologically sound. A great many 
racks line this room, upon which the skins of many beasts are suspended, 
awaiting preparation. A pungent odour wafts around the workshop causing 
you to edge back towards the sweeter smells of Nimrodel Way, to the north.

Outside the House of The Elven Lord~
To the north stands a great house of dark grey granite. Many narrow
openings are set in the stone, and sculpted figurines adorn the white
lintel which runs all the way around the building. A huge, oak door stands
at the top of a set of wide steps which sweep up between two flower
beds. Above door is a large, deep bronze plaque bearing elven symbols
which are too complex for you to read. From here you can also see the
roof which towers into the sky. It is of a steep gothic design, constructed
from startling duck egg blue tiles and midway along the roof ridge there
stands a vast, squared, smoking chimney. A white pathway heads south,
and east into what appear to be some hedged gardens.

In the past you have heard rumours of a magical shield which protects
the house of the Elven Lord, but you can't see any evidence here....

The Gallery~
Works of art of varying scales adorn the walls and shelves of this room.
This display of fine Elven art fills you with awe, for the pictures and
sculptures are perfectly coloured, and are almost gruesomely detailed.
Light shines into the room via a narrow slit in the western wall,
supplemented by that of a large crystal chandelier which is suspended
from the centre of the stone ceiling. A hallway leads south, or
you can try the large oak door to the north.

You have entered a small, musty room full of tables and racks which have

The Map Room~
Similar to the scriptorium to the east, the map room contains a great
many scrolls, some of which have been thrown upon the floor. There is
a single, enormous wooden table in the centre of the room and upon it
lies a vast map of the locality. Looking at it closely you can make
a few words such as 'Minas Tirith' and 'Mordor'. The latter, for some
explicable reason, sends a shudder down your spine. An oak door stands
to the east.

The Great Hall~
You enter the western wing of The Great Hall. Several arrow slits in the
stonework of the southern wall permit beams of light to shine upon the
contents of this vast room. A huge fire along the north wall roars with
a tremendous heat, alongside which stand double oak doors. Your footsteps
are dulled by the thick layer of reeds which have been scattered far
and wide. A few comfortable velvet chairs tempt you into taking a brief
rest. The Great Hall stretches off into the east, but you may go both
north or west through oak doors.

the old storyteller~
An old, story telling hobbit sits here, writing poor poetry.
~
This hobbit is reaching the end of his days and by the looks of things,
he's been through a great many adventures in his time. Now, his
lack of energy means that he is only capable of writing and reciting
tales of legends, mystery and magic.

As you look at the hobbit, his physical form flickers into translucence
for a moment. You blink just in case this is a trick of the eye but the
hobbit once again appears to be whole. Curious.

As warriors go, this one looks fearsome. His long, blonde hair has been
tied back and the ornate armour which he wears makes no sound as he moves
stealthily towards you. The expression on his face indicates that
he would not be happy if you were to attempt to proceed further into
the lands of his kinsfolk.

This almost inexplicable, magical phenomenon is normally invisble to the
naked eye, but its magical presence permits you to see every ripple and 
surge of energy which flows through it. This ancient  device is what
protects the House of the elven Lord from the powerful evil forces which
roam the planet. However, this field is not infinite in power and it is
rumoured that should the lord of Darkness rise again, Imladris would be
defenceless and the House would be crushed utterly.
