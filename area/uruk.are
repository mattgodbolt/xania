page and are pleasantly surprised to see text in a language which you are
able to read! It says, "The Book of Evil Fire, by Uruk leader of the Uruk-hai.
This book is the pinnacle of my life's works. Do not use it, for its power
shall destroy you!" You shudder at the thought.

The Perilous Causeway
    *** CAUTION - ENTERING HIGH LEVEL AREA ***

You pick your way across a narrow causeway which heads north towards
a large set of doors built into the mountainside, and back south towards
some grassy plains. The rocky scree is insecure and you lose your foothold
several times. The mountain looms over you and the sense of impending doom
is overwhelming.
