The Reception Area~
This room is very barren.  There is a desk in the center of the room
which looks very functional.  There is one painting on the wall, you can't
quite make it out, because it is what these new artist fools call abstract.
There is a small sign here and a door to the North.

********  WARNING  ********
This area is not for level grubbers.  It can be very
dangerous, and you could die, and even loose your
corpse.  It was designed to be a challenging area
with many secrets and some cool EQ, but if you plan
on an easy ride forget it, it's not here.

This must be where the cultists conduct their cermonys, glofifying the
Dragon.  You are now treading on their sanctified ground, take care
not to step in the center where a circle is drawn in chalk upon the
ground.  It seems this circle  is the center of attention of this entire room.
And to think the cult wanted you to join!

You have discovered what the Cult was hiding, and if the Black Dragon
Wyrmling didn't "tell" you himself, the gnawed bones and large piles
of Dragon defication should.  And they were intending on feeding another
virgin to this horrible creature.  You shudder to think what this
Wyrmling will be like if it ever grows up.  The only exit is to the South.

she runs her own office.  Gale is the backbone behind the business
side of the orginization.  The employee's don't even bother with Fred,
the boss, they just come here.  There is a desk here with some papers
on it and some certificates on the wall. The only way out is back to the east.

anything ever gets done in here, or maybe not so, because nothing ever really

This is a hallway that people to sneak around, just in case.  It is
not used very much, except by Fred and Marie who come in here to
discuss cleaning sometimes.  Oh yeah then Bob and Marie also use this back
area too.  But never Bob and Fred oh no that would cause trouble, though Fred
wouldn't mind using this hallway with Gale, that wouldn't be bad at all, But
secretly Gale wants to use the hallway with Bob, but Bob doesn't know this and
spends his time in here with Marie, wishing that Marie looked like Cindy (no
there is no Cindy in this area). Oh well maybe this hallway is used alot.
