Sheer face~
You are at the bottom of a sheer face.  The rock here is dark, sharp and
distinctly menacing.  Glancing upwards you see a huge shadow looming above
you - what can it be?  You can see a path in the mountain to the west.

Flying above the cliff-face~
You are flying above the cliff-face.  Below you is a path in the mountain,
and further above you can see a huge flying chunk of rock!  What can this thing
be - and how can you find out?  Upwards seems the only way to find out.  To the
far north-east you see a fortress in the mountains.

You find yourself in a smelly alleyway.  The walls are oozing a red
substance, as if the walls themselves are bleeding.  There must be some
hideous magic holding the citadel in the air, and the terrible strain on the
rocks is manifest.  The alley continues to the east and west, and a small hole
to the south permits you to leave the citadel.

Citadel South-East~
You are in a T-junction, between an alley which runs from east to west, and
one which continues to the north.  There is a rope-ladder here which leads to a
trap-door in the ceiling.  On the cobbled floor are various bits of broken
armour, all coated in blood.  More worryingly, there are half-chewed arms and
legs, of both draconian and human race.  Obviously whatever was eating this
is partial to any kind of flesh ... maybe even yours!

Citadel South-West~
You are at a T-junction where an alley meets a corridor - the alleyway runs
from east to west, and the corridor continues northwards.  The floor is
cobbled, and in a heap next to you lie a pile of bodies.  The bodies have
been doused in some flammable mixture and are burning slowly.  The
sickly-sweet smell of decay assaults your nostrils and you feel sickened to
the core as many of the bodies have been hideously mutilated...and some are
still moving...
A rope leads to a trap-door in the ceiling, from which you hear distant
groaning.

and rotting flesh is enough to keep you away from it.  A column of smoke winds
its way gently upwards through a crack in the trapdoor.

#13009
Western Wing~
The alleyway ends, rather abruptly, at a brick wall.  The only source of
light is a huge hole in the wall, about ten feet up - but it has been barred
over, perhaps to prevent anyone escaping ... although they'd only be escaping
to a four hundred foot drop...

Eastern Wing~
Here the corridor disappears into a 400 foot sheer drop!  You can hear the
rushing of air, and you feel the wind ruffling your hair.  The scorched cobbles
make you wonder if the damage was caused by some huge siege weapon, or was it
simply that the structure of the citadel couldn't take it any more.  The only
exit, other than a 400 foot plunge, is to the west.

Transmogrification extrapolator~
The room is almost filled by a huge copper tank which has a tap attached to
it, at about waist-height.  Every four or five seconds the tap drips and there
is a nearly-clear puddle of liquid beneath it.  At the top of the tank is a
complicated network of pipes which leads to a funnel-shaped device attached to
the north wall.  You imagine that this is some kind of air intake.  The pipes
are heated by a burning torch which has been suspended underneath them.  You
see a stairwell to the east, and a doorway to the south.  A trapdoor is set
into the floor.

Goblin explosive factory~
Upon entering the room you notice the acrid smell of explosives and slightly
singed hair.  This is some kind of assembly line for explosives to power the
cannons on the lower deck.  Draconians and orcs have too much self-preservation
to even go near the explosives, but the goblins are stupid enough to assemble
the potentially lethal cocktails to create explosives.  To the north is a
strange machine, and a doors lead east and south.

Kitchen~
This room is bustling with activity; draconians making their excuse for food,
from meat they have presumably 'collected' themselves.  A cooking pot sits on

Two sturdy wooden tables, with curious channels gouged in them are the main
features in this room.  They are stained almost red, and you wonder why.
Glancing at the wall you notice a set of crude instruments hanging up - and you
realise you have entered the draconian's crude infirmary.  The draconian bones
in the corner lay testimony to the ineffectiveness of the 'treatment' given
here.  There is a door to the north, and you see a staircase to the east.  A

asleep or even better dead!  Apart from the mats, the room is bare of all
creature comforts, and is drafty, cold and dank.  The draconians are surely a

This room is most odd - it is full of manacled snotlings.  Quite why these
poor creatures are chained here is not immediately obvious - but glancing
around you notice a large spike on the ceiling.  Each snotling is wearing a
helmet with a spike on it - and if you look carefully you see some kind of
magical lightning jumping from the snotling's head to the spike on the ceiling.
You guess that these poor creatures are being used as some kind of magical
battery - perhaps this is where the power that hold the citadel up come from.

This wretched individual is a Dewar - a dark dwarf - imprisoned for who knows
what reason - perhaps he has double-crossed the draconians too many times.  He
seems to be suffering from the terrible conditions in the prison - but then so
are you!

An escaped prisoner staggers around.
~
This bedraggled, and very ill-looking, Dewar dwarf has escaped from the dungeon
and is wandering around randomly, burbling insanity.  There are flecks of spit
in his white beard, and his eyes are bright red.  Still trailing his manacles
behind him, this Dewar is not going to get past the guards in this state.

A rarity indeed - a Bozak or draconian magic user.  Only once or twice a
century is such an abomination hatched on Xania - and this Bozak looks only
too keen to blast you into oblivion!  With one clawed hand raised, he traces
an evil sigil in the air and prepares to attack.

the evil draconian cleric~
A draconian cleric tends to the injured warriors.
~
This draconian is a worshipper of the evil draconian god D'zkhul - long
banished from Xania, but whose influence can be felt here still.  Dressed in
black robes and wearing an effigy of D'zkhul around her neck, this draconian
is undoubtedbly the embondiment of evil.  She is tending to the fallen
warriors here, not for any humanitarian reasons, but simply as the draconian
fighting force must be kept at its peak to further the draconians' evil goals.

The old man has been afflicted by some evil curse.  From the waist down he has
been petrified.  He notices your interest in him:

  ``My tale is a long story.  Suffice to say I have been hideously tortured
    by the Bozak mages - their  never-ending quest to destroy the forces of
    good.  They have forged a small city and by  some immense magical power
    have imbued it  with the ability  of flight - a flying  citadel!  I was
    the first to discover their evil plot - and how I have payed for it!''

The man sighs deeply, and continues:

  ``Be warned, adventurer.  You must use magical powers to get to the cita-
    del, and when you get there you must be careful!''

This goblin has been consigned to the job of taking the potentially lethal

lighting the fuse.  It is a foolish individual who stays near the charges
when they go off!  The goblin is covered from head to foot in soot, and has
reddish strips running down his back - more likely than not the legacy of a
whip.

He is wielding a mighty two-handed axe using just one hand - for his right arm
is that of a dragon's!
