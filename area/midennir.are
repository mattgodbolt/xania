The Plains~
   You are standing on the plains. This is a vast desolate place where the
wind can howl undisturbed since nothing but you bars its way. However you
are not the first to wander here. Before you somebody has left a small path.
The path looks rather bewildered and is not the kind of path to lead to
anywhere significant or important but it seems to have made up its mind to
enter the hills far away north.

     As you explore further into the mountainside, the tunnel gets smaller and
smaller to the south.  You almost have to hunch over to make your way thru
this area.  A small archway to the south leads into a large chamber.

The Goblin Headquarters~
     The tunnel widens into a large (well, large for goblins) cavern that
serves as the living quarters for the goblins of Miden'nir.  The bones of
numbers woodland creatures are strewn about the room, the remanents of a
recent meal.

The Front of the Inn~
     You are standing on a well-worn path which opens into a clearing.
An old, wooden building is here with smoke billowing from its
chimney. A painted sign is visible on the porch to the west. You
could go north or south around the building or leave this place and
return to the forest.

North of the Inn~
     You are standing north of the inn. Things don't look much different
from this angle.  The air here is filled with smells of smoke and cooking.
South, the front porch is waiting for you... or you can see if there is
a back door.

South of the Inn~
     You are standing south of the inn.  You could easily go north and enter
through the front door, or west and to the rear of the establishment.  You
here some muffled cries from a tiny trail leading south of here.

Behind the Inn~
     You now stand behind the inn. The smell here is not so pleasant as
the keeper and his help throw a good deal of garbage here. A couple of
piles of rubbish are to the west, but you will smell the worse for
meddling there. As a clean alternative, you can go north or east around
the inn.

The Woodsman Inn~
    You are in the common room of the Woodsman Inn. A thin haze of smoke sits
in the air here. The Inn is often empty, as the forest has become overrun by
goblins as of late, and it is no longer safe in these parts. The bar is just
north of here. If you'd rather have your own table, one is empty to the
south.

The Ambush Point~
     This is a overgrown foot-trail south of the inn. It leads west, but you
would be hard pressed to follow it far. A number of bushes are trampled on
and some medium sized branches have been knocked down.  Obviously there has
been a battle here rather recently.

The Bar~
     This is where people use to come and enjoy the food, drink and hospitality
of the innkeeper, but as of late, he only serves the few adventurers that
manage to survive a trip thru the forest. You can leave south and return to the
common room.

wooden chairs sits here.  There is a large stain on the table, the remnants
of a spilled drink.

make any further exploration impossible.  Fresh tracks cover the ground, and
end right here.  The horsemen must be nearby.
