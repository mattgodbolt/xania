are not the first to wander here. Before you somebody has left footprints.
The footprints make a path that looks rather bewildered and is not the kind
of path to lead to anywhere significant or important but it seems to have
made up its mind to enter the hills far away north.  A little distance
further, you lose the trail and decide not to get lost.
