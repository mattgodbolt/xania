Inside a Tavern~
You are inside a dimly-lit room.  The atmosphere makes you feel uncomfortable.
In front of you stands a mysterious gypsy.  She whispers 'Your fate and
destiny lie beyond this world.'  You are still wondering what she means when
you suddenly notice the crystal ball ... it glows fiercely and displays the
Universe!

Inside the Galaxy~
You are now inside the galaxy, around you you see stars and nebulae smiling
at your presence, and comets and meteors wandering around you.  You realize
that this world may not be the true galaxy after all, but just another
fantasy zone.  Exits lie virtually in all directions.

Indeed it is too bright to tell.  Because what you are witnessing is the
rare event of a Supernova, how a star explodes itself into galactic dust.
You may find yourself lucky to witness this rare event but even luckier,
you have finally got out of this galaxy as your body turns into dust.
That really HURTS!
