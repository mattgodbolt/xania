village.  Around the gate there are two pedestals.  On the first

are in the process of clearing the desert of those annoying
sandtraps.  Unfortunately one of my men had wandered into the
dragon cave and was slayed by that evil creature.  We need
another knight, and also he had a moonstone.  Thank you, my
liege.

engraving~
Pilgrim,
     You have reached the final step on your way to enlightenment. 
In this last step you will be shown ultimate evil to your north,
and ultimate food to your south.  This is the land of the undead.

Both those whose goodness links them to the land, and those whose
evilness was rejected dead are here.  To have true spirituality
one must know both.  Once you have been strengthened and forge
through the evil, there is one final test before you prove
yourself equal to the Avatar himself.  You must endure the test
of time.
