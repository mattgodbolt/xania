North entrance to the catacombs~
You are almost surprised to see a tunnel leading off to the south
into utter darkness.  The floorboards above you haven't been moved
in a long time, yet there is life down here.  A beam of light from
the opening above you falls upon a message scrawled on the wall here.

The message reads:
     Adventure for the strong yet calculating
     Death for the weak and shallow
     Treasure for the smart and lucky
     Death for the stupid and accursed

An ancient Glyph above the entrance keeps monsters from wandering up
from the catacombs.

North/south tunnel~
This part of the catacombs looked roughly hewn and man-made. There is
a large cross painted on the floor of the tunnel.To the south it seems
maybe a bit lighter for some odd reason.  To the north a ray of light
comes in from a hole in the ceiling.

the south streams darkness.  A message has been scrawled upon the wall
here.  The message reads:
     Adventure for the strong yet calculating
     Death for the weak and shallow
     Treasure for the smart and lucky
     Death for the stupid and accursed
An ancient Glyph above the entrance keeps monsters from wandering up
from the catacombs.
