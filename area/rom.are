1 ISCA ISCARIANS~
Xania is  a land  which was once  populated by  the ancient Iscarians.
Legend has it that this race of people  held a culture of great beauty
and wisdom. It was their early efforts at  creating a peaceful, lawful
society which resulted in cities such as Midgaard being founded in the
otherwise barbarous Xanian  lands. Their original temple still  stands
today in Midgaard   and it is  there  where  you can see  some  of the
examples of the Iscarian livelihood. 

Many an  age has passed since the  construction of the city and during
that time, evil  infiltrated the works of  the Iscarians. It came from
the  wild outlands, manifested  in the form of blood-crazed barbarians
who brought unparalleled terror to the innocent and death to those who
did not submit. 

Nobody really knows the source of this  potent malice, but Midgaardian
scholars who have studied the stars have come to  a concensus that the
Iscarians were a   race doomed to  destruction ever   since their very
creation. For it  is believed that the source   of their demise  was a
fundamental floor  in  the design  of the  cosmos itself; something so
powerful that even the mighty  Isca-sorceri, the Iscarians learned  in
the ways of magic, were unable to thwart its progress. 

Apart from the Temple  of Isca and a  few  of the tomes  detailing the
Lore of Xania, there is very little left of the Iscarians today. A few
scattered   peoples roam  the  land   claiming  that  they are  direct
descendants   of Isca but few   acknowledge  this, and  some, such  as
disciples of   the Great Wyrm,   hold a  completely different  view of
Xanian history and hold the Iscarians in contempt. 
                             
                                -- adapted from Book II, Lore of Xania

92 JOBS~
This is a partial list of what a god of any given level should be doing. It is
not complete yet.


Heroes:
You should be helping mortals in minor ways (i.e. not handing out free spells
right and left).  An ideal example is leading quest parties or missions to 
get corpses...don't just get the corpse for a person, make them come along and
help you do it.

Angels:
Angels and higher level gods may not assist mortals directly in any way.  
An Angel's main job is to help with quests (via switch), or possibly run
small quest of their own -- but the rewards should be minimal.

Deities:
Deities have two main roles: reimbursement and quest running.  Be skeptical
on reimburses, don't just hand out every piece of gear.  I suggest limiting
reimbursements to |W10 items at a time|w, and make sure that you do not load things
at too high a level (new format items have hard-coded levels, so are not a
problem).  vnum and stat are useful for this.  You can draft Angels to help you
run a quest, and please note that quests should NOT have huge rewards -- the
main point should be to have fun.  Deities have no business trying to enforce
rules -- the most you should do to a player is a NOCHANNEL or similar light
punishment.

Gods:
Gods can run quests just like Deities, and it's nice to do reimbursements too.
However, the main role of a God is keeping the peace.  Gods can enforce (but
not create rules), using the various NOTELL-class commands, as well as deny,
purge, freeze, and ban (but be careful with these commands!)  Gods are expected
to help make the mud run more smoothly, power trips are strictly verbotten.

Not fufilling the roles of your office can result in demotion or deletion.

Guidelines for the Immortals of Xania                                16/9/95
==============================================================================

Having ascended to the realms of immortality, you have become the ultimate
being, the pinnacle of existence in the universe. Your powers, as you know
only too well, are mighty, far greater than those of any mortal. Therefore,
you should use them wisely for both your own pleasure and to carry out the 
task of acaring for the world in a manner which you see fit.

You can do more or less what you want, but there are certain limitations, and
you must not behave 'ultra vires', beyond the law, otherwise the you might 
find that a God with bigger muscles than you is going to get angry =).

Firstly
-------
In a situation where your attention is required, just use your basic built
in common sense. Little else can be better, do whatever best suits the
circumstances. Most of the guidelines here are common sense anyway.

YOU MAY NOT!
------------
Use your powers to help mortals:
   - to level
   - to heal
   - with finding equipment and/or areas
   - with enhancements  and enchantment

Move mobs around:
   Don't move mobs about, especially aggressive ones. If there are 
circumstances where what you are doing requires moving/switching a mob then
do so, but please put it back afterwards! And for heavens sake, don't put
high level mobs in low level areas. Slaying the mob is a quick way to put
it back, of course.

Snoop!
   |WYou may not snoop players.|w Period. People use muds to have private
conversations and it is up to you to respect this. Circumstances where you
CAN use snoop might be as follows:
   - a player thinks there is a bug/problem with his character, so you can
     see what the problem is with snoop.
   - if a player is being hassled by another player and it is reported to
     you, use snoop on the victim (with his/her permission) to catch the
     culprit red handed. If possible, also capture the events to a text file
     and this can be used as evidence.

Player Kill or slay. Need I say more?

   - slaying is a technique which can be used to fix a problem with a 
     character sometimes, please  don't slay out of anger or you might
     find yourself slain too =)

Other points
------------

CRs:
   - with corpse retrievals, you must leave it to the mortals to help each
     other out. If there are no mortals available or willing to help out
     or the situation is quite obviously beyond anyone with lesser 
     capabilities than yourself =) then |Wyou are responsible for getting the
     player back to his/her corpse.|w Don't ever let yourself get the 
     reputation as an Imm who will always do a CR, otherwise the higher
     level mortals might get lazy.
   - |Rreimburse a player if their corpse is lost in a crash|w (hopefully there
     won't be too many of those!).

Wizi:
   - if you are Wizi, then there are fewer things more annoying for a mortal
     than if you talk them whilst remaining invisible. Reveal yourselves to
     them when you're chatting about something, you can always go invisible
     again afterwards. Of course, becoming visible means that players will
     know that you are logged on. The solution is to stay visible all the 
     time and when you do disappear, they'll probably assume that you're not
     there at all!
  - to hide behind invisibility all the time is to avoid facing up to your
     responsibilities. Please don't do it.

If!:
   - a player is quite evidently there just to cause trouble or to spam then
     give him a few stern words. If it's blatantly nasty behaviour (e.g.
     spamming swear words on the gossip channel) then nochannel them or
     just kick them off. This also applies for a rude character name.
     If a name has a slightly sexual connotation, but seems to be a current
     player who is having a quick joke, then that's ok. Play it by ear.

Multi-assisting:
   - this is forbidden and if you spot it occurring, then approach the said
     individuals and question them. Be careful, things may not be quite what
     they seem though; it may well be one player just helping another.

   - warn cheaters of Deletion penalties then note a level 98+ or to
     an implementor. If that player is caught again, they're in mucho trouble.

   - if you materialise suddenly before them, that will probably scare them
     shitless anyway and they'll stop (he says with an aura of innocence =))
     If necessary, transfer them to |Rthe Realm of Death (1212)|w in the 
     immortal zone to let them cook for a couple of minutes. That room should 
     be inescapable. Of course, don't go over the top and make them quit 
     because of hatred (perhaps fear!) of the mud.

Loading:
   - you may load any objects you wish but you may not give equipment out
     to mortals unless it is to reimburse them for a lost corpse. You can
     also load objects for mortals if they are genuinely needed to run a 
     quest (harmless items only though, like food restrung as items with
     interesting names) Of course, load objects as prizes for your own, or
     other immortals' quests.

Restrings:
   - Don't hand them out to mortals, they're special and must be earned. You
     or any other immortals may string as much as you like for yourselves
     though. Restrings may be given out as special quest prizes. 
     No 'Personal Quests' just yet please until Wandera has figured out how
     quests will work here on X.

92 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~
.
                         **********************
                         *  |R The Rules of  X |w *
                         **********************
 

                >>> For Extended Rules read |RHELP XIMM|w <<<


1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.
 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
 
8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  
 
10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

-1 PUFF~
No plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --
He grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.
Compiles and simulations grew so quickly tame
And swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.
CHORUS:
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
Puff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails
And mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.
All the student hackers loved that fractal Puff
But DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, "Enough!"
                (chorus)
Puff used more resources than DCS could spare.
The operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.
A gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,
But Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!
                (chorus)
~

-1 RULES~
These are the rules of |RX|w.  For other matters, use common sense.
* No player stealing or player killing. Period.

* excessive foul language will not be tolerated in Xania, from anyone
  (including gods). Punishments range from deletion to NOCHANNELing.

* sexual harassment of any form will not be tolerated, punishable by deletion

* your presence here is a privilege not a right
 
* |YAbsolutely no multiassisting! You may have more than one character logged
    on but do not use them to help each other! If you're caught, you're
    in BIG trouble.|w
 
* no kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is 
  fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs.

* cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.
~




-1 STORAGE~
If your character is not logged in during a period of 14 consecutive days,
it will 'disappear' into storage and will need to be restored by an 
implementor. 

    On the login screen you will see:

    'Did I hear that right - <name> (Y/N)?' if your character has been
put into storage. 

To get restored to your former self, write a note to immortal (do 'help note' 
if you don't know how to) and state the following:

    - character name
    - character level (approximately)
    - the approximate date when you last played
    - your e-mail address (optional - we can mail you and tell you if you've  
                           been restored or not!) 
With luck, you'll be back in shape fairly soon afterwards.
~
-1 ROM~
In the  beginning, there was ROM.  (Actually, it was  in February, but
that's  beside the point)  Then, ROM was updated to  ROM II, and for a
while there were  two ROMs, separate  but not equal.   Sadly, all good
things must come to an end, and in a mighty flash  of write heads, ROM
I was taken from this earth. Now there is ROM II, the mightier of the
two, and  many  mortals eager to perish   in the  quest for glory.  In
further development, ROM II was released, and here we are.

-1 STORY XANIA~
Xania was created by The Moog, Death, Faramir, Rohan  and Wandera,
five bold Gods who saw fit to create a new world where
peace and happiness would reign. Sadly, (due to  sheer incompetence)
they made a nasty mistake somewhere along the line, and an infestation
of evil spread chaotically throughout  the realm. Thus, this place is
no longer safe and it is up to you, bold adventurer, to face up to the
prospect of meeting an untimely demise! 

A special thank you to the original immortals and heroes who contributed
to Xania's success, you can see their names using the 'wizlist' command.

And it goes without saying, Xania would have been nothing without the base
code and areas that shipped with Rivers of Mud (ROM), its sister mud, MadROM,
and before that, DikuMUD and MERC. We owe a debt of gratitude to the original
developers and zonesmiths.

For more credits see:
    'help rom', 'help diku' and 'help merc'.

See 'help isca' for some Iscarian lore.

0 DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
~
 
0 HEALER~
Throughout Xania, there are some special individuals who are hold
great healing abilities. The most widely known healer is the Iscarian
druid who resides at the Temple of Isca, Midgaard, although there are
rumoured to be others dotted around the landscape.

The healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some
services are still free to players of level 5 or below, however.  To see
a full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To
receive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal spell'.
~ 

-1 TAX TAXES~
Xania charges a tax on the wealthiest players, to help pay for all the sub
issue equipment and guard death benefits.  This tax amounts to 50% of all
gold above 250,000 coins, each and every time you log on.
~

-1 GAIN~
The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has 
been found.  The following options can be used with gain:

gain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned
gain points:  lower your creation points by 1 (costs two sessions)
gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert: turns 10 practices into one training session

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train')
Gained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total
number of creation points. 
~

95 CLONE~
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~


0 SKILLS SPELLS~
The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in
order of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)
listed where applicable.
~


0 OUTFIT~
The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), 
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.
~

0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT
AUTOPEEK~
ROM uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassit : makes you help group members in combat
|Wautopeek|w  : if you have the peek skill, this will toggle its use

brief           activates and deactivates short descriptions
compact         used to remove most 'empty' lines of text
nosum           toggle between state of summonability
nofol           prevent people following you, and gets rid of pets
|Wshowafk|w         toggles between whether tells are logged when you are afk
noloot		permits or denies looting of your corpse

Typing a command sets the action (except for autolist), typing it again removes
it. 
~ 
-1 BRIEF COMPACT NOSUM NOFOLLOW SHOWAFK NOLOOT~

brief           activates and deactivates short descriptions
compact         used to remove most 'empty' lines of text
nosum           toggle between state of summonability
nofol           prevent people following you, and gets rid of pets
showafk         toggles between whether tells are logged when you are afk
noloot          permits or denies looting of your corpse
~


-1 COUNT~
The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~ 
 
-1 GATE~
The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a portal 
between your character and another person or creature somewhere else in the
world.  This portal will transport you and any pet you might have, but not
other members of your group.  Monsters recieve a save against gate, and
monster or players s more than 3 levels higher than you can not be gated to at 
all.  God rooms, private rooms, and no recall rooms cannot be gated to, and
no recall rooms cannot be gated out of.  Finally, any god or hero is also 
immune to gate, as well as in player who has no summon set.
~

-1 WEB~
The Xania web pages are to be found at |chttp://xania.org/-xania|w
(replace the - with one of those squiggly tildes)

To get a web page for your own character, leave a note or talk to Faramir.
These are intended mainly for roleplay use, so if your character has 
an interesting background or perhaps devious motives, you can place a 
short resume on the pages, along with graphics!
