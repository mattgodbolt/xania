Concordius~
Concordius~
Concordius stands here keeping the peace.
~
Concordius is a tall imposing figure with a weathered face that suggests great
experience. 

Word has it that Concordius is some kind of arbiter, or arbitrator, 
or was it arboretum? You didn't quite catch what the guy said.

A lightweight toga spans his lean body. An intricate claw-like
object adorns to his right hand, and a bronze shield depicting a sun is 
strapped to his left arm.

Although he seems to be quite relaxed, his upright posture and alertness
indicate that he is ready to respond at a moment's notice.
As he speaks, his sonorous voice leaves you feeling enlightened.

Melancholy~
Melancholy is here, digging through a pile of scrolls, papers, and maps.

Ragged brown hair frames a ghostly, pale face.  Puffy eyelids surround two
sky blue, haunting eyes.  An old, brown robe is wrapped around her frail
frame.  She looks up from her pile of papers and maps and looks inquiringly

A tamed eagle perches on a wall.

Astradamus the Summoner kneels before the summoning stone. 
~
Astradamus is a berobed druid with a bald head. You see that where his eyes once
were, only a pair of blackened sockets now remain and it leaves you wondering what
happened to him.

His palms rest gently on the great summoning stone and filaments of light
from its runes appear to meld with his fingers.

scroll parchment page~
Xania is  a land  which was once  populated by  the ancient Iscarians.
Legend has it that this race of people  held a culture of great beauty
and wisdom. It was their early efforts at  creating a peaceful, lawful
society which resulted in cities such as Midgaard being founded in the
otherwise barbarous Xanian  lands. Their original temple still  stands
today in Midgaard   and it is  there  where  you can see  some  of the
examples of the Iscarian livelihood. 

Many an  age has passed since the  construction of the city and during
that time, evil  infiltrated the works of  the Iscarians. It came from
the  wild outlands, manifested  in the form of blood-crazed barbarians
who brought unparalleled terror to the innocent and death to those who
did not submit. 

Nobody really knows the source of this  potent malice, but Midgaardian
scholars who have studied the stars have come to  a concensus that the
Iscarians were a   race doomed to  destruction ever   since their very
creation. For it  is believed that the source   of their demise  was a
fundamental floor  in  the design  of the  cosmos itself; something so
powerful that even the mighty  Isca-sorceri, the Iscarians learned  in
the ways of magic, were unable to thwart its progress. 

Apart from the Temple  of Isca and a  few  of the tomes  detailing the
Lore of Xania, there is very little left of the Iscarians today. A few
scattered   peoples roam  the  land   claiming  that  they are  direct
descendants   of Isca but few   acknowledge  this, and  some, such  as
disciples of   the Great Wyrm,   hold a  completely different  view of
Xanian history and hold the Iscarians in contempt.

    To whom it may concern,

        Merc Industries has installed a new no-rent save and quit
        system.  Apparently one can now save and quit at any time
        from anywhere inside a town or out.  My services here are
        no longer required.

The Temple of Isca~
You find yourself at the southern end of a great hall in the Temple of Isca.
The temple is beautifully crafted from the finest Morian marble, and
huge tapestries adorn the walls.  A stairwell leads upwards into the Mud
School, and the hall continues to the north, where it ends at a lavish altar.
The Temple square is to the south and there is a plaque on the wall.

the sacred altar. The centre of activity in this city is immediately

Your feet stand upon the vast expanse of the Temple of Isca. Here, a 
beautiful marble altar has been placed, its sides engraved with ornate,
mystical runes and symbols. 

Under the altar, stone steps wind downwards towards the necropolis.

Pillars of the purest white pearlescent rock stand firmly on either side,
supporting a deeply arched roof. The whole temple is brightly illuminated by
the end of a rainbow which cascades down above the temple, almost reaching
into the donation pit which opens before your feet. 

In the corners of the hall, stand statues of mythical and 
legendary figures whose exploits form the ancient history of Xania.

form, but a huge X instead. You assume that this has some sacred
meaning which the original creators of the temple wished to bestow
upon their home. 

The other corners hold vast torsos of mighty warriors, mages,

Kate's Diner~
The smells of baking bread and simmering stew lead you dancing through
the doorway of the diner.  No greasy spoons to be seen here-- the
booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood,
rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards
carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some
musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the
wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window
looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock
and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south
returns you to Austral Square.
On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing
a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival
Pull up a chair, perhaps play a game, and take time out to talk.

slightly less clutter than the rest of the shop is in front of you.  A scroll
case full of scrolls is behind the desk.  A bookcase is to the left of you,

  An somewhat unpleasant smell assaults your nose as you walk through

are among the more recognizable odors.  They seem to be the standard
aromas of a good butchers shop.  Various slabs and shoulders of beef,
deer, rabbit and other animals hang on large hooks along the walls and
in rest piles on butchering blocks.  A sign hangs nearby. Large wooden

absence of any windows.  The room is surprisingly well appointed with
tapestries hanging on the walls.  Large oak cases are situated in the
back of the room, obviously designed for displaying jewellery.  A simple
work bench is located to the front of the shop and a few tools are strewn
about on it.  There is a heavy door in the back of the room.  You assume
that it leads to the jewellers back room where he stores his valuables.

    Dive.  That's all you can say about this place; its a

on the floor toward the center of the room.  There's no
decorations on the wall; they've all been ripped down in anger
or for use as weapons at one time or another.  Looking around,
you search vainly for a clean table to sit at, and then give up.

manner about the room.  Merchants wander in and out of a back door, moving
strange boxes filled with mysterious goods and bound for exotic locations.
A schedule for the various caravans is posted on the walls.  This is the
local trading post.  It hums and buzzes with excitement.

woman is standing near him and singing a tale of comedic heroism. Drunk
men sit laughing at their tables and busy bar maids weave through the
crowd with full mugs and horns of ale and mead.  Another part of the pub
is located to your west. The bar is to the south.  A set of steps occupy
in a corner of the room.  They lead up to the inn section of this

and a couple of end tables give the room a `homey' atmosphere.  A large
stone fireplace burns brightly against one wall and warms the room.  A
large oak desk is nestled in one corner of the room.  A small man with
wire-framed glasses sits behind the desk working dilligently on his books.
He looks up as you enter the room.  He looks at you quizzically.  He is
probably waiting for you to ask him for a room.

caskets of all shapes and sizes stacked up against the walls.

A stone pillar etched with mysterious glowing runes pulses with a
pale light. This must be the Summoning Stone of Astradamus!
