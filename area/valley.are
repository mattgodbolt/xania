#HELPS






0 'VALLEY ELF'~
Valley elves are as tall as most humans.  They are thin and have sharp and
pointed features.  They are reclusive and resent intrusion.  All other sorts
of elves, including the drow, shun valley elves.  The latter, in turn, dislike
association with any races save perhaps gnomekind, whom they tolerate.
