This is a bright, alert little creature, covered in a pelt of short, light

look in its eyes conveys both an air of self-confidence and an ample

Its skull face stares down at you with an impassive grin, before rubbing
a bony finger along the blade of the huge scythe it is carrying. Actually,
it appears to be quite a friendly looking entity, especially considering
the circumstances of its existence.

can only be used for the purposes of clan finances in the lands of Xania.

Each piece of Krellstone is hewn from a larger chunk called the Krell-arda.
The Krell-arda can only be found at the very core of Xania itself, so it is
the rareness of this material, and its great durability which makes it so
precious to the Gods. They are willing to allow mortals to use Krellstone as
a store of wealth, as long as they get each back before the end of time.....

You step into a small wardrobe that is simply full of nasty old

you, causing a feeling of impending claustrophobia. The wardrobe seems

You enter the living room of the immortals of X-Rom. There is a large,
brown, comfortable sofa here, standing on the polished wooden floor.
A well worn rug lies before a low, glass coffee table and a TV set
sits in the corner. Over on the other side of the room you notice
an awesome looking stereo system that appears to be quite capable
of blowing the whole of Midgaard into outer space! There is a picture
of Keanu Reeves on the wall that has been covered in graffiti and
various obscenities. There are doorways in all directions and you
can't but help detect a smell from the west.

You step into an icy cold, dark chamber which is illuminated by an
enchanting blue light. The walls have been tiled and huge rusty
chains are swingly gently from the ceiling. A modern, steel and
leather chair sits in the centre of the room and you can almost
swear that you saw it on some TV show once. An unpleasant reddish
liquid shimmers beneath your feet as is it failing to flow down
the drain which the plumber failed to fix yet again. Typical.

Faramir's Gaff~
You step in to what appears to be a harem containing a giggling gaggle 
of the most goggling girls the Gods graced any planet with. 

The strong dose of drugs circulating through your body quickly subsides.

You now find yourself in a cosy little bedroom featuring blank yellow
walls, a solid black table and a boring pine bed. The large glossy
'The Matrix' poster on the far wall features a particularly fine shot
of Carrie-Anne Moss' voluminous and eminently comfortable breasts in
addition to Keanu's charsimatically challenged haircut. 
A chubby computer sits under the table, its disk whirring like a hair
drier in a 70s barber shop. The view from the window is green and 
unremarkable except for the perma-sunset on the horizon that Faramir
nicked from Death while he wasn't looking.

The Moog's Bedroom~
You wade through knee-deep rubbish into The Moog's bedroom.  You dread
to think what colour the carpet is - as it has not seen the light of
day for several centuries anything could have happened.  Eerie lifeforms
which have seemingly evolved to subsist from rubbish and undergarments
writhe around.  In short, this room is a mess!  A computer desk stands to 
the south corner of the room, again littered with rubbish, and coffee cups.
A small network of various computers labour intently around and about the
desk - why The Moog would need more than one computer you just don't know.
One of the machines is running a developmental version of Xania - as you
glance at the screen you see it crash with a nasty error - another bug for 
The Moog to fix, by the look of it.  A 56k modem glows red next to the 
monitor; its LEDs and that of the network hub are the only sources of light
in the room.

The stony silence of this room is broken only by the loud ticking of a

sit tiny hourglasses, each one carefully named.  You glance upon an
hourglass with your own name inscribed upon it, and you worry as there

wondering if its a unix box or a PC. In the corner you see a Guitar covered in
dust as is most thinga here. The one thing that makes this box so different
from all the other rooms in this place is the walls, they arnt just covered
with tiger posters, pictures, and paintings, but, there are pictures ontop of
tigers ontop of the posters. (I think it can be said that Luxor Likes Tigers)
You see a filty rugby ball on the floor (Boy has that seen a few scrums)

forage under the noonday sun.  A feeling of tranquility passes over you as

that you don't recognize the writing of but you guess that it might
be Hebrew.  In the corner, you notice a piece of parchment with Greek

You enter a brilliant white room.  To your left stands a closed fumehood, 
as you peer closely at the flasks inside you can see what looks like some 
fairy liquid being boiled and turned into freshly squeezed orange juice.  
Over by the far wall stands a glowing Rega amplifier that is used to heat 
the room as well as deafen all who enter.  As you stumble round the lab 
you trip over a pair of discarded DMs and fall head long into the largest 
pile of CDs you have ever seen.  Gradually your eyes become adjusted to 
the glare of the overhead fluorescent bulbs and you notice an unmade 
camp bed set up just in front of you.  Clearly Harlequin wants to be close 
to his work, but what on Xania is he making?  A cure for cancer, a 
vaccine against AIDS, nah its just something to clean the fridge with.

Tajil's Basement~
Upon climbing down into a small, pipe-filled basement, you instantly duck 
your head to avoid collision with a precariously suspended ventilation duct. 
Bits of gravel and old nails crunch underfoot as you step across the dusty 
concrete floor, surveying Tajil's belongings. A green shag carpet covers the 
far half of the floor, and the dim candlelight allows you to see various 
band posters and flyers adorning the freshly painted navy blue walls. Tajil 
has been forced to adopt a monastic lifestyle, as is evident by his use of a 
pile of broken water-pipes and old fur coats from upstairs as a bed. 
Apparently, times have been rough lately, and the Imps were hard-pressed to 
grant Tajil anything more than a utility room as his immortal domain. 
Shelved in the far corner, a slowly spinning record player hisses and skips, 
punctuating the echoing silence of the basement.
