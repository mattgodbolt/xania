Shiriff Post of the Lower Shire~
You are in the shiriff Post which acts as the nucleus for the three shiriffs 
of the Lower Shire.  As you examine the shiriffs on duty, you come to realize
that the halflings of the Shire are not to be reckoned with.  You cower with
awe.  The only exit is to the east.

Forrey's Burrow~

The sun streams in through a round East-facing window, lighting this earthy
den with its soft, orange glow.  In a far corner, you notice a majestic
grand piano with its lid slightly ajar.  It looks as if it's often used,
but not as often as the unassuming, but 287MHz, light grey box humming
gently beside a large oak desk.  Just across from the window is a beautiful
watercolour of rolling hills, flowing rivers and wide sweeps of trees, under
which, propped against the wall, is a bulging rucksack filled with hiking
gear.  To the West is a blue door with a bronze handle.

There is an amazing air of peace and serenity here.  With the gurgling of the
river, the singing of the birds and the dappled sunlight shining through the
light green leaves above, this must be the most beautiful and relaxing place
you've ever seen.  Just to the North, a path winds its way right to the
very top of Took Hill.

bulbous nose belie his true nature.  An elven sword that glows with a blue
light hangs from his belt, and on his finger you see the One Ring.  Although

to take away that which belongs to him.
