Entrance to the Shadow Grove~
Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.
  A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the road.

underfoot, and the signs of fire here and there. It is almost as if the
plant life shuns this spot. The shadowy mist hovers all around, obscuring

From here, it is obvious that somehow, the tower is much larger on the
inside than it is on the outside. Young mages walk about, completely
oblivious to your presence.

a plain hallway and back south through the gate.

a huge black oven against one wall, it must be at least 12 feet high.
Opposite the oven is an equally enormous meat locker, large enough to
comfortably store several hapless adventurers no doubt. In the middle of
the room, hanging in mid-air is a spice rack.

casting you cannot tell.

He looks quite mad, no doubt he's been mistreated horribly.
