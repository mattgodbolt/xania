Entrance to the Shadow Grove~
Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.
  A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the road.

underfoot, and the signs of fire here and there. It is almost as if the
plant life shuns this spot. The shadowy mist hovers all around, obscuring

Inside the High Tower of Sorcerery~
You are inside the high tower of sorcery. The sight is truly amazing.
From here, it is obvious that somehow, the tower is much larger on the
inside than it is on the outside. Young mages walk about, completely
oblivious to your presence.
  Exits lead north to the common room, west to the dinning room, east to
a plain hallway and back south through the gate.

are taking a break from their rigorous studies. There are benches,
tables and a small water fountain here, otherwise the room is quite

a huge black oven against one wall, it must be at least 12 feet high.
Opposite the oven is an equally enormous meat locker, large enough to
comfortably store several hapless adventurers no doubt. In the middle of
the room, hanging in mid-air is a spice rack.
