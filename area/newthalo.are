The Dancing Daemon Inn~
A huge circling wet-bar takes up most of the east end of the Daemon. An
old mage reclines against the mirror behind the bar absentmindedly pouring
several drinks at once with his refined telekinesis. The Lokettes, a local
band, are playing their usual gig on the stage. The large booths along the
wall are filled with people drinking and having a grand time. You feel like
partying here.
The only obvious exit is to the north.

so you have to assume the noise comes from the Butchery. You have to
think for a while before you muster the will to enter this shop.
The market continues to the south and west.

Vera's Veggies~
This is a busy place.  Customers shuffle around, bartering for lower prices
on the wide selection of vegetables.  You can still hear your mother telling
you 'Eat your Veggies'.  That's probably why you're mudding right now and
not hanging out with mom.  But wait...Vera looks just like your mother!

A long oaken table, coverd with silverware, plates, and a tablecloth
with gold trim, dominates the room. Although no diners occupy the room
as of yet, servants sprint about setting the table and placing condiments.
The kitchen entrance is to the east, and two huge double doors open into
the hallway north.

and west of you the grassy fields continue and north, in the distance,
you see a line of trees.

The river delta~
This is where the river empties out into the Dragon Sea. The backrush
of water has kicked up a lot of sand and the blue sea is stained where
the river empties. Looking east, all you can see is water....all the way
to the horizon. North of here is a small dock you think you should be
able to reach with out too much trouble. The river stretches off to
the west back towards New Thalos.

On a road~
The people of New Thalos take great pride in the services their
city may provide. One of these services is the construction crews
that go to great lengths to keep all the roads in order. Although
the taxes in New Thalos are higher than other cities in the realm
most of the money is used for the good of the people.
