Shady Wood~
Huge dark coniferous and deciduous trees loom around you, blocking out
most of the light from the sky above, hence the distinct lack of lower
level vegetation. From the east you can hear the sound of water, whilst
the wood continues to the north and south.

Fountain of Delight~
In the centre of the ominous darkness of the towering wood lies a highly
ornate fountain which appears to glow with goodness. The ground around
is saturated with water so evidently this is a popular spot for skinny

This is a deforested area, empty of life and very gloomy. The lack of

You are in an extremely dark section of woodland, but somehow you manage

a strange metallic pole and to the north there is a huge hole in the
trunk of a mighty tree. The darkness continues to the west.

Dark Wood~
You have entered a very dark section of woodland - the liquid shadow
engulfs you and almost begins to fill your lungs. The silhouette of
a large tree ascends to the sky. It has had handholds driven into it
and thus appears to be climbable. The darkness spreads to the east but
fades in the north and the woods continue to the south.

Within the Mighty Trunk~
You have stepped inside a huge hollowed out tree trunk which is illuminated
by an uncanny ethereal light which has an indefinable, diffuse source.
The inside of the tree is full of etch marks and blackened scorches.
The floor is strewn with leaves and the husks of thousands of nuts which
are beginning to hide your feet already. A pin prick of light shines down
from through the top of this dead tree many tens of metres above.

Here you stand upon sun parched grassland to the east of a dark wood.
A path begins to form eastwards whilst there are increasing numbers
of tree stumps in the west. Some construction is being carried out here
as the grass has been cleared to bare topsoil and various piles of materials
lay strewn about the place.

Amidst the high branches of the mysterious black trees many broad planks
have been lain to form a solid structure some eight metres above ground.
There is an  almost deathly silence in this place except for the continuous
sighing of the wind through the multitude of branches and limpid leaves.
No further upward progress can be made in this tree.

Here there is a crossroads leading in all directions. To the north the

You can see a sign at the intersection.

your interest, particularly due to the fact that the curtains have been
looped over each other and tied together. Curiouser and curiouser....

dripping a familiar red substance which then runs through the rivulets
of the tiled floor. You can only guess what lies huddled beneath the
white sheets in the corner of the room.

There is also a desk over by the eastern wall of the room. The magical

the graveyard for decaying, odorous antiquities. The lack of any windows

fail to establish why they are not rejoicing. Suddenly the mosaic appears
to come alive and a maiden glares at you with icy eyes. A voice in your

and halfway along each length. One of the machines starts playing music
which you immediately find extremely irritating and you start to consider
ways of stopping it.  On the walls are loud posters featuring pictures
of many different people wielding swords and other unrecognisable weapons.
This really is a weird place.

Spurts and gasps of superheated steam flash before your face. Blackened
oily pipes thrust into the darkness in all directions and your footsteps
crash against the insecure metal grilles below. You see glowing eyes
in the darkness, hiding behind the pipes and you gulp in fear of the
unknown. The heat is gradually rising and the contaminated steam, cackling
evilly, tickles your face.

You decide to redefine the meaning of the word "darkness" as you step

The icy hand of despair grips you as you scramble through this huge,

 on the opposite side of the chasm, attempting to bend your will against
yourself and unto their submission. You avert your eyes, clench your
fists and continue on.

and the temperature around you rises slightly, creating a unique and

the house and you feel compelled to enter. You only see faded yellow
curtains through the windows and no sound permeates through the walls.
A pathway runs north.
