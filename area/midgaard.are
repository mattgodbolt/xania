Ragged brown hair frames a ghostly, pale face.  Puffy eyelids surround two
sky blue, haunting eyes.  An old, brown robe is wrapped around her frail
frame.  She looks up from her pile of papers and maps and looks inquiringly
at you, smiling faintly.

scroll parchment page~
Xania is  a land  which was once  populated by  the ancient Iscarians.
Legend has it that this race of people  held a culture of great beauty
and wisdom. It was their early efforts at  creating a peaceful, lawful
society which resulted in cities such as Midgaard being founded in the
otherwise barbarous Xanian  lands. Their original temple still  stands
today in Midgaard   and it is  there  where  you can see  some  of the
examples of the Iscarian livelihood. 

Many an  age has passed since the  construction of the city and during
that time, evil  infiltrated the works of  the Iscarians. It came from
the  wild outlands, manifested  in the form of blood-crazed barbarians
who brought unparalleled terror to the innocent and death to those who
did not submit. 

Nobody really knows the source of this  potent malice, but Midgaardian
scholars who have studied the stars have come to  a concensus that the
Iscarians were a   race doomed to  destruction ever   since their very
creation. For it  is believed that the source   of their demise  was a
fundamental floor  in  the design  of the  cosmos itself; something so
powerful that even the mighty  Isca-sorceri, the Iscarians learned  in
the ways of magic, were unable to thwart its progress. 

Apart from the Temple  of Isca and a  few  of the tomes  detailing the
Lore of Xania, there is very little left of the Iscarians today. A few
scattered   peoples roam  the  land   claiming  that  they are  direct
descendants   of Isca but few   acknowledge  this, and  some, such  as
disciples of   the Great Wyrm,   hold a  completely different  view of
Xanian history and hold the Iscarians in contempt.

    To whom it may concern,

        Merc Industries has installed a new no-rent save and quit
        system.  Apparently one can now save and quit at any time
        from anywhere inside a town or out.  My services here are
        no longer required.

The Temple of Isca~
You find yourself at the southern end of a great hall in the Temple of Isca.
The temple is beautifully crafted from the finest Morian marble, and
huge tapestries adorn the walls.  A stairwell leads upwards into the Mud
School, and the hall continues to the north, where it ends at a lavish altar.
The Temple square is to the south and there is a plaque on the wall.

The Temple Square~
This is the most southern end of the Temple of Isca. The surface of
the marble flooring has been chipped and worn by the thousands of feet
which have trampled through here since Midgaard was founded. To the
north, a fine set of curved steps opens before you, leading towards
the sacred altar. The centre of activity in this city is immediately
south of you, at Market Square. You hear faint sounds of battle high

Your feet stand upon the vast expanse of the Temple of Isca. Here, a 
beautiful marble altar has been placed, its sides engraved with ornate,
mystical runes and symbols. Pillars of the purest white pearlescent rock 
stand firmly on either side, supporting a deeply arched roof. The whole
temple is brightly illuminated by the end of a rainbow which cascades down
above the temple, almost reaching into the donation pit which opens before
your feet. In the corners of the hall, stand statues of mythical and 
legendary figures whose exploits form the ancient history of Xania.

form, but a huge X instead. You assume that this has some sacred
meaning which the original creators of the temple wished to bestow
upon their home. 

The other corners hold vast torsos of mighty warriors, mages,
barbarians, divinities and legendary explorers, none of whom you

Kate's Diner~
The smells of baking bread and simmering stew lead you dancing through
the doorway of the diner.  No greasy spoons to be seen here-- the
booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood,
rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards
carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some
musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the
wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window
looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock
and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south
returns you to Austral Square.
On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing
a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival
Pull up a chair, perhaps play a game, and take time out to talk.

slightly less clutter than the rest of the shop is in front of you.  A scroll
case full of scrolls is behind the desk.  A bookcase is to the left of you,

Market Road~
  You are at the eastern end of Market Road.  To the east of you, the
tall wall around the city looms up before you and casts its shadow on
you.  Market Road continues to the west.

A Butcher's Shop~
  An somewhat unpleasant smell assaults your nose as you walk through
the open door of the shop.  The scent of raw meat, blood and sweat are
are among the more recognizable odors.  They seem to be the standard
aromas of a good butchers shop.  Various slabs and shoulders of beef,
deer, rabbit and other animals hang on large hooks along the walls and
in rest piles on butchering blocks.  A sign hangs nearby. Large wooden
numbers hang from a large nail on the sign.

A Jeweller's Shop~
  A few strategically placed lanterns keep this shop well-lit in the
absence of any windows.  The room is surprisingly well appointed with
tapestries hanging on the walls.  Large oak cases are situated in the
back of the room, obviously designed for displaying jewellery.  A simple
work bench is located to the front of the shop and a few tools are strewn
about on it.  There is a heavy door in the back of the room.  You assume
that it leads to the jewellers back room where he stores his valuables.

Grebe's Tavern~
    Dive.  That's all you can say about this place; its a
dive.  You step carefully over the dead and/or drunk sailors
on the floor toward the center of the room.  There's no
decorations on the wall; they've all been ripped down in anger
or for use as weapons at one time or another.  Looking around,
you search vainly for a clean table to sit at, and then give up.

The Trading Post~
  Bolts of cloth are stacked in monstrous heaps around the room.  Barrells
of spices fill the corners.  Crates and boxes are stacked in a haphazard
manner about the room.  Merchants wander in and out of a back door, moving
strange boxes filled with mysterious goods and bound for exotic locations.
A schedule for the various caravans is posted on the walls.  This is the
local trading post.  It hums and buzzes with excitement.

A Florists Shop~
  The fragrant scent of flowers in full bloom embraces you as you enter
the shop.  Pots and bowls with roses, petunias, daisies, tulips, and
carnations line the shelves along the walls.  Smaller pots of herbs and
spices rest on tables near the front of the room.  A counter stands in
the back of the room.  A woman is there, trimming some sort of small,
green plant.

Andy's Pub~
  The busy pub is filled with patrons.  People are laughing and singing.
A minstrel plays his lute in another part of the pub, and a few people
are even dancing.  Andy, the pubs owner, wanders around and checks to see
that the needs of his customers are met.  The bar is to your south.  East
of you is another section of the pub.  You know that there are rooms to
be had somewhere around here...

The Combat Room~
You stand in the centre of a large circular room. There are exits in all
directions. The walls are made of tough grey stone, the floor is covered
with a thin layer of sand and in some places blood.
This place looks old, like it has stood here for centuries.
Are you ready to fight and maybe die in such a place?

The preparation room~
You are in a plain but comfortable room. A large fire burns to the south.
In the centre of the room is a table. Upon the table is some bread and water.
Take your ease, eat and drink. You must be fit to fight.

Be calm, you are quite safe. Now you must prepare for your duel.
When you are ready walk north into the Combat room.

A Room in the Pub~
  This part of the pub is filled with dancing and singing.  A wandering
minstrel is on a chair in a corner with his lute.  A busty red headed
woman is standing near him and singing a tale of comedic heroism. Drunk
men sit laughing at their tables and busy bar maids weave through the
crowd with full mugs and horns of ale and mead.  Another part of the pub
is located to your west. The bar is to the south.  A set of steps occupy
in a corner of the room.  They lead up to the inn section of this
prosperous establishment.

behind the bar.  Bottles of strong, nasty looking liquids decorate one
of the lower shelves.  A large cask rests on a table behind the bar.  A
strong but friendly-looking bartender stands next to the cask polishing
glasses.  A couple of the bar maids stand in a corner and throw the most
inviting glances your way.

The Inn~
  You are standing upstairs from Andy's Pub at Andy's Inn.  A few chairs
and a couple of end tables give the room a `homey' atmosphere.  A large
stone fireplace burns brightly against one wall and warms the room.  A
large oak desk is nestled in one corner of the room.  A small man with
wire-framed glasses sits behind the desk working dilligently on his books.
He looks up as you enter the room.  He looks at you quizzically.  He is
probably waiting for you to ask him for a room.
