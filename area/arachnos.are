On the spider web~
You are balancing carefully on the giant sticky threads that holds the giant
web in place.  To the south leads a strand to a cave-like structure made from
many layers of a spider web.  Another silky strand continues to the north.

Webbed Entrance~
Sticky, sticky, sticky!  The ground is cluttered with leaves, decayed
remains of webbed crickets, beetle, rats, dogs (?), and even humans.
You begin to wonder about what lies ahead.  The air is damp here,
and even the little light that shines through the canopy seems
absorbed into the webbing.

some bear and small deer bones in fact.  No human skeletons are visible
