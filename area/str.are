Spherical Room~
     The room is very dark.  As you take your first step into the room, you 
feel that a round object is under your feet.  *BONK*  In the first minute you
wonder whether you have just stepped on a bomb and have been killed.  Then as
you observe the room in details, you discover that the ball you have just 
stepped on is a balloon, not a bomb.  A sign is here on the wall.  The only
exit is the door to the west where you have entered.

     South of where you are standing is a wide, magnificent river.  The river
is NOT an ordinary one.  The water flowing is green and steam is rising out of
the river.  It must be very hot indeed.  There is a path to the north, but
you may jump into the river south of you.

examine the machines more thoroughly, you see that there are two oval-shaped
metal shells in the room.  According to your knowledge, these two shells must
be telepods.  You may enter the telepods to the north and south of the room,
or you can leave to the east.

Bomberman was made, Dr. Mad was very satisfied with his talent and he 
continued to create Bomberman II.  However, in the final process of the 
creation of Bomberman II, an earthquake hits the base and Bomberman II became 
alive unexpectedly.  Dr. Mad was both confused and impressed with the birth of 
Bomberman II.  When he took his first step towards Bomberman II, he sensed  
the evilness of the Bomberman II and fled immediately.  But Bomberman II was
too powerful and it smashed Dr. Mad to the west wall.  Before Dr. Mad's last
breath was out, he carved his story here on the wall.
