The hills~
   You are on a small bewildered path winding its way between the hills in
lack of better things to do. To the south you have a splendid view over the
flat, vast, desolate plains. To the north the hills grow steadily darker and
foreboding. This is the cause of no sunset, it is rather the power of evil
penetrating these quiet hills. Glancing around you notice only a single bird.
The mountains of the dwarven kingdom rise up to your east, you can barely
make out the queen's mines from here.

The hills~
   You are surrounded by dark and sinister hills. Although they seemed fairly
small from a distance you now get the feeling that they're closing in on you,
towering over you, overwhelming you ...  The small path seems to have second
thoughts about these hills because it starts winding unnecessarily, turning
several times around itself.  To the south the hills have a lighter hue of
dark. To the north however, the hills have become nightblack holes in the
distant mountains.

End of the path~
   At this point the path has had enough. With a terrified shudder it cowers
to the ground, only staying here because you're standing on it. with a slight
feeling of unease you look around noticing only a few bushes and a large sign
carved into the mountain.  You feel you can hear the cry of help from a
thousand silent voices all coming from an even darker hole in the mountain to
the north marking the entrance to a cave (or a grave :-).

The cave~
   You are in a large cave. The ceiling is lost somewhere above the reach of
your light. The floor, however, is highly illuminated, your light flickering
over several tombstones. Only one is whole, the rest have been shattered by
some savage blow. The remaining tombstone looks disturbingly new...
A small breeze of fresh air enters from the south (probably lost too). Take a
good breath, it may be your last mouthful of air in a long, long time that
others haven't breathed before you.
To the north a small tunnel continues into the mountain.

The tunnel~
   You squeeze your way through a small, narrow tunnel. The sharp-edged rocks
protruding from the walls threaten to scratch and cut you. 
To the south you sense a freshness in the air which is rather unusual in these
damp, stuffy tunnels. To the north the tunnel continues.

The tunnel~

the flickering light. To the south the tunnel narrows even more making it
almost impossible to pass. To the north it slowly widens into a cave. There
is a branch of the tunnel going west.
