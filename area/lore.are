Stone path~
You stand on an old stone path leading north towards a very small round 
tower. The pathway has been heavily worn by the elements and the
pounding of a thousand feet, but the thick tangle of bracken and 
musty grey tree branches on either side appear to be preserved.

You enter a broad courtyard and are suddenly overcome with awe. The 
place is huge, more than huge, it's unfathomable. Just how did they fit 
such a huge room within the confines of such a small tower? Beneath 
your feet a huge marble chequered floor stretches beyond you, making you 
feel even more like a small pawn in a very big game. Above you the 
ceiling depicts the incredible scene of the raging dragon wars. Strangely 
despite the enormity of the place you feel at peace in the sanctuary of 
this place.

Before you stands the altar of the Keepers of the Lore. A beautiful 
waterfall is in front of you cascading from up high. The ceiling is 
glass and the sun beaming through it produces a rainbow in the mist 
of the falls. This room is quite busy with Lore members moving to and 
fro. Others just sit and read in the tranquility of this room.
One of the walls has a plaque on it, next to the plaque is an elegant 
stone statue of a mighty hero.

the shoulder number in pigskin, to the more up-to-date all over body 
wrap in platinum. At the farthest end of the room a large glass cabinet 
is set which claims to hold within it "A Vision of the Future", within 
which two men, one in shiny black and one in long brown flowing robes are 
battling with what seems like beams of light...|Wvery|w strange.... A

Before the gates of Lore Keep
[The Clan of Keepers of the Lore]~
The silence of the forest of Haon Dor falls about your ears and you 
become aware of the flickering shadows in the trees as the multitude
of inhabitabts flit around, attempting to avoid you steely gaze. The
community of deciduous and coniferous trees is interrupted here by 
what appears to be a small, grey stone tower to your immediate north.
A large, rusted portcullis covers the blackened entrance tunnel, but
through it you can just about see a torchlit courtyard. A trail leads
south through the trees.
