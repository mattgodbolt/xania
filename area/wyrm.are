Temple Gates
[The Clan of the Disciples of the Wyrm]~
You stand before the vast |Cgates|w of the Temple of the Great Wyrm. The
temple seems to be built from a solid block of white marble and the 
whole structure radiates an intense aura of goodness.  At the far side of 
the temple, a tall lone tower rises up to a dizzying height. You can hear 
a soft chanting carried to your ears on the wind but you can't quite make 
out the words.

You look more closely at the statues.  The grandest statue by far is that 
of a huge dragon in combatant pose.  Looking at the statue you can't help 
but admire his build and rugged but attractive features   You notice a 
plaque that reads "Samael The Headpriest of the Disciplehood".  The 
second statue that catches your eye is of a dragon of similar dimensions and
features. The plaque for this statue states  "Harlequin The First High 
Priest of the Great Wyrm".

walls.  To the east is a portal with a sign above it and to the west is a

The End Of The Corridor~
You stand at the far end of the dingy corridor.  You shudder 
apprehensively as you consider what awaits you behind the doors which lie 
to the east, west and north.  But If you are courageous and brave you can 
overcome these trials and honour your clan.

You are in a largish cell.  A pentacle is painted on the floor in a

are adorned with elegant tapestries and fine paintings.  Light streams in 
through vast arched windows on the southern wall.  There is a ornately

At the wyrms feet lie the broken bodies and charred remains of those that 
would oppose him.

paintings~
The first painting you look at shows the temple flowing with the blood of 
loyal brother dragons.  You see a cowardly elf standing over a sleeping 
dragon, as another dragon grapples to defend its fellow.  The second painting 
shows the temple again with the vast form of the great wyrm behind it, the 
treacherous elves withering and decaying.  The final painting of the temple
shows the restoration to its former glory and once again filled by loyal 
disciples.

Trophy Room~
This is a vast room filled with trophies and memorabilia from battles which 
the clan has taken part in.  On the walls are the mounted heads of many evil 
beasts that have been slain by clan members and weapons that have been taken 
from fallen enemies or that once belonged to great heroes of the disciplehood.
Several fine suits of armour stand in the corners and on the northern wall 
there are shelves filled with books and scrolls.  The only exit is to the 
south through a pair of double doors.

Looking at the suits of armour you feel a shiver run down your spine.  
It seems almost as if the mighty warriors that once wore these suits are

orbs which glow brightly and are warm to the touch.  There is a second

Feasting Hall~
This room is dominated by a huge table which must be large enough to 
seat a hundred disciples.  Rather than chairs there are huge, wooden benches 
to sit on. At the far end there is a grand throne, the seat of the Preceptor
of the Wyrm, flanked by two only slightly less grand thrones for the high 
priests.

Before the Oracle~
This is an enormous room with a high vaulted ceiling.  It is almost 
completely filled by a huge statue of the Great Wyrm.  Incense is 
burning in crucibles which line the walls and torches smoulder in scounces 
casting eerie shadows that dance about the room.  You stop and listen for 
a moment, feeling sure you can hear a slow, steady heartbeat and faint 
breathing.

are no longer in the temple, but are surrounded by nothingness.  The 
Great Wyrm opens an eye and stares at you for what seems an eternity.  
Suddenly you are back in the temple again.

The crucibles are full of pungent herbs that are smouldering slowly.
