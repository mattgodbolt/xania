Road to Newfane~
You are on a gently curving north-south road.  On your east side a youthful
river sparkles blue and rushes in the sunlight.  On the west, green leaves and
green ferns burst against the rich brown earth.  You feel the heat of your
healthy muscles as you travel swiftly down the well-paved road.

Newfane Village Square~
You are on the lawn of the village square of Newfane, resting against an oak
after your vigorous journey.  The late spring breeze feels warm and sensuous
on your body.  An Ale is in progress: you spy more than a dozen fiddlers and
hundreds of Morris Dancers dressed in white cotton and wearing colorful hats
and bells.

A Large Dance Hall~
You are inside a large dance hall with a very polished, very slippery wooden
floor.  You see three long lines of dancers, alternating men and women, in
some sort of progressive country dance.  Two fiddlers, a flautist, and a
harpsichord player provide the music.  You hear scattered screams of joy
from the dancers.

A Small Hall~
You are inside a small hall with a rough wooden floor.  You see dozens of
people in the hall chasing one poor man who is yelling at the top of
his lungs.  Wait a minute.  These people are all holding hands and smiling!
The man in front is leading them in a spiral!  They're DANCING!  And you
thought people didn't dance like this any more!

An Old Wooden Church~
As you enter the hall, you see the largest crowd of people you've ever seen in
your life.  They're also the noisiest crowd you've ever heard, and as they
press around you, the SWEATIEST crowd you've ever felt!  At the front of the
hall, a group of musicians are playing 'Chorus Jig'.

Mountain Road~
You are following a road at the top of a mountain ridge with sky all around
you.  Distant valleys are spread out below you on both sides.  There are
many horsemen and horsewomen on this road, riding hell-for-leather out of
sheer exhilaration.  You wish you had a horse!
You may recall now if you like.

The Void~
You are suspended in cool electric space above a translucent plain.  You feel
synesthesia invading your nerves and reshuffling your senses.  The sky is the
same obsidian color as the ground and you can't find a horizon.
