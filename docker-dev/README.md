Developing the Mud with Docker & Visual Studio Code
----------------

## Intro

This README was written by Faramir in May 2022, last updated in April 2025. It's aimed at people who are interested in using a Docker container to build, run and debug the mud. It was written with an emphasis on running the Docker container on a **Windows** box rather than Linux or Mac, although it should work fine there too, just ignore/substite mention of things like Power Shell for the *nix equivalent :)

If you're running Windows, you don't have to use Docker to build the mud. You can take the simpler path of using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) directly. The downside to that is that you won't get VS Code's nice integration with Docker containers, but that won't matter if you're comfy using an editor like Vim or Emacs.

The container layers a moderate number of tools on top of the *Ubuntu 24* base image. It's possible some important tools are missing, you're free to customize it as needed, and/or get in touch on Discord.

*Please be careful!* -- Don't put any important credentials into the image itself and publish the image to an untrusted image registry!

## Windows Setup

First, install WSL2. Follow the steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Make sure it's set to use Linux containers not Windows. 

Then install Docker Desktop for Windows. You can grab it [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/release-notes/).

After that, you should be able to install a test image and start up a container to confirm Docker is working OK, e.g. from Power Shell:
```bash
docker pull hello-world
docker run --rm hello-world
```

## Install Visual Studio Code.

You can get it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Then install these VS Code extensions:
- Docker
- C/C++ Extension Pack
- C/C++ Intellisense Extension
- Clang-Tidy


## Build the Image

The image build steps create a user called `mudder`. This is the user you'll be running as when you enter the container.

The build relies on _Docker BuildKit_ to read a password variable and set it as the `mudder` password. The following commands include a step to set a password of your own choosing. Afterwards in the running container, use that password when using the `sudo` command to run things as `root`. You're free to change the password at any time with `passwd` of course.

Copy the `Dockerfile` from the sources into a local folder, such as `your_user/Documents/Docker`. Then in a Power Shell session run:

```bash
$Env:MUDPASS = "set_your_own"
$Env:DOCKER_BUILDKIT = 1

docker build --secret=id=mudpass,env=MUDPASS --progress=plain --rm -f Dockerfile -t mud:latest .
```

If all goes well, an image tagged as `mud:latest` should appear. You'll see it in the Docker Desktop app's Images panel, or you can list it with `docker image ls`.

## Create a Volume

The approach taken is to create a single persistent volume that is independent of the image itself and will be mounted on the `mudder` user's home directory path. That's where you will put the mud's git repo and make long-lived customizations.

```bash
docker volume create mudhut
```

## Launch the Container

There are a couple of ways to do this. 

### Launch from Terminal and Attach Docker Extension

This is my preferred way of doing it because it's really simple and being able to slam `ctrl-d` in a terminal to shut the container down has a certain appeal.

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v mudhut:/home/mudder mud:latest
```
Fire up `tmux` if you want to multiplex the terminal. You can spin up multiple tmux windows with `ctrl-b c`,  and switch between them with `ctrl-b n`. See more tmux shortcuts [here](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/).


Now you can attach VS Code.  In its _Docker_ sidebar you will see `mud:latest` under the *CONTAINERS* section. Right click and _Attach Visual Studio Code_.  This will open a new VS Code window and the file navigator will be centered on `mudder`'s home directory. Plus VS Code will have a terminal panel ready for you to use.

From here you'll be able to do almost everything, including launch the mud's CPP Debug launch targets!


### Launch with VS Code Remote Containers

This is a bit more fiddly. As we want to mount the mudhut volume, it is necessary to add a config setting to tell it do that.

- F1, _Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files..._
- Choose the option to pick an existing Dockerfile
- It'll open up a new `devcontainer.json` file.
- Customize it like so:
```
{
	"name": "Mud",
	"context": "..",
	"dockerFile": "../Dockerfile",
	"runArgs": [ "-v", "mudhut:/home/mudder" ]
}
```

More about that config [here](https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json).

- You should be able to F1 run _Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container_ on the parent directory where `devcontainer.json` was written. 
- That directory will be mounted inside the container under `/workspace` and in VS Code's terminal pane, your session will start out in that directory. You'll probably want to cd to `mudder`'s home though and work there.

## Setting up the Container

There are now various setup tasks to consider doing, some being optional:

- You might want to run `sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata` to set your timezone.
- Generate fresh SSH keys and GPG signing keys, or copy existing ones over from another environment. That's not covered here.
- If your terminal colours are wonky try adding this to `~/.profile` -- `export TERM=xterm-256color`.
- Clone a fork of the mud's repo e.g.
```bash
mkdir dev
cd dev
git clone git@github.com:your-user/xania.git
```
- Kick off a build. Running the build will install various dependencies before compiling the apps and tests:
```bash
cd xania
make
git checkout -b my_branch # and let the hacking commence!
```
- The image includes the `aws` cli should you wish to use it for things on AWS. Just copy your configs & creds into the volume.


## Running Doorman & Xania

At this point you can run `doorman` and `xania`. There are alternative ways to do this depending on whether or not you want to use VS Code to debug. My personal preference is to do this:

- I start `doorman` from my bash/tmux session like so. Note that both apps look for several environment variables as mentioned in the top-level README. There are some reasonable defaults set in `mud-settings-dev.sh`. 
```bash
. mud-settings-dev.sh
./install/bin/doorman
```

- I start `xania` in debug mode in VS Code. From its _Run and Debug_ sidebar, the launch menu at the top will include several targets out of the box because there's a set of `.vscode` configs in the project's base directory, and VS Code will detect these automatically. Just use the one called _Debug Xania_.

Here's a screenshot of VS Code (2 windows, 1 connected to the container) and a tmux session in the container:
